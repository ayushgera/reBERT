drop out cains white house bid is effectively over.cain said he came to the decision after assessing the impact that the allegations were having on his wife his family and his supporters.cain and his wife gloria held hands as they walked up to the podium where cain made his remarks in atlanta. the crowd chanted gloria gloria before the candidate spoke.even as he stepped aside under the weight of the allegations that have dogged him cain said that he was at peace with my god and peace with my wife.he repeatedly called the allegations false and untrue and added that the media spin hurts.i am not going to be silenced and i will not go away cain said announcing what he called his plan b a website thecainsolutions.com through which he will continue to advocate for his platform.his catchy 999 economic plan is not going anywhere he said.your support has been unwavering and undying cain told his supporters.he will endorse another of the republican presidential hopefuls soon he said.other candidates were quick to react.herman cain provided an important voice to this process minnesota rep. michele bachmann said in a statement. his ideas and energy generated tremendous enthusiasm for the conservative movement at a time it was so desperately needed to restore confidence in our country.fellow georgian newt gingrich said the 999 plan got our country talking about the critical issue of how to reform our tax code and he elevated the dialogue of the republican presidential primary in the process.texas gov. rick perry said he knew the cains made a difficult decision. he helped invigorate conservative voters and our nation with a discussion of major tax reform.former utah gov. jon huntsman said cain brought a unique and valuable voice to the debate over how to reform our countrys uncompetitive tax code and turn around the economy. i understand his decision and wish him and his family the best.recently cain acknowledged that ginger whites allegations of an affair have led to a drop in campaign contributions and a des moines register poll showed his support among likely republican iowa caucusgoers has fallen to 8% down from 23% in october. the poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 4.9 points the newspaper said.respondents said they were most concerned that cain does not understand important issues but said the allegations against him contribute to their concern the newspaper said.this week white told the news media that she and cain engaged in an onandoff affair for more than 13 years. she described the affair as very casual.white issued a statement through her attorney after cains announcement saturday.ginger white respects mr. cains decision regarding his campaign and indeed would have respected any decision he made the statement said. that being said she is disappointed that he has not apologized for the public statements he has made about her and other women who have spoken out.in a fundraising letter tuesday night cain referred to white as troubled.two women  sharon bialek and karen kraushaar  previously accused cain of sexually harassing them in the 1990s while he was head of the national restaurant association. two other women also have said cain sexually harassed them while they worked at the association but they have declined to be identified.cain told the union leader in new hampshire that he repeatedly gave white money to help her with monthtomonth bills and expenses. but he denied the relationship was sexual as white contends. he said the two were friends.i send checks to a lot of people i help a lot of people cain told fox news on thursday. that in itself is not proof. so the other allegation in terms of it being a 13year physical relationship that is her words against my word.in the interview cain said his wife knew nothing about white nor his financial support for her until the mother of two came forward last week.my wife now knows he told the newspaper. my wife and i have talked about it and i have explained it to her. my wife understands that im a softhearted giving person.cains announcement came a month before the iowa caucuses the first formal test of the primary season scheduled for january 3.new hampshire republican officials who supported cain began to survey their options saturday with several state representatives saying their support could go to gingrich or ron paul. cains most prominent supporter in the state former gop state party chair jack kimball said he would wait to learn who cain would endorse before making his own decision.cain told staffers earlier this week he was reassessing his campaign in the wake of whites allegation of an affair and he acknowledged to reporters wednesday that her account had led to a drop in contributions to his campaign.he said in the thursday union leader interview that his wifes feelings as well as the reaction from supporters and donors would be important factors in deciding whether he will stay the race.cain told the newspaper he would drop out of the race if his wife asked him to but quickly added that she wouldnt.though gloria cain rarely makes public appearances or statements she told fox news last month that she believed the sexual harassment allegations were unfounded.cnns rachel streitfeld contributed to this report.new woman who alleges an affair with cain wants an apologycain will endorse another

                    "context": "washington cnn  a hearing continues thursday to determine the future of john hinckley jr. who shot president ronald reagan and three others in march 1981.after an expected week and half of testimony a federal judge will consider whether hinckley should eventually be released from a mental hospital where he has been a patient since his 1982 trial. the trial ended in a jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.on wednesday hinckleys lawyers said he is not dangerous and should eventually be released. but prosecutors are fighting that saying hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in williamsburg virginia.in opening statements prosecutor sarah chasson said secret service agents will testify they performed surveillance on hinckley without his knowledge earlier this year when he was allowed what he was told was unsupervised free time in williamsburg.on several occasions in july and september hinckley was supposed to go to the movies or shopping but instead went to bookstores where he looked at books about ronald reagan and presidential assassins chasson said. a requirement of hinckleys current visitation program is that plans be laid out detailing what he will do when on his own and that medical staff and the secret service are informed.according to chasson in the first instance in july hinckley was supposed to go to the movie captain america. later when he saw his treatment team hinckley not only maintained he had gone to the movie but he enthusiastically recommended it.chasson also quoted from a 1987 diary entry by hinckley in which he said psychiatry is a guessing game and doctors will never know the true john hinckley.the hospital doesnt know what mr. hinckley is thinking and he wants it that way the prosecutor said.hinckleys attorney barry levine said the issue is not whether hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous.this man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous levine said. he added that hinckley is flawed but is fundamentally decent.levine said that in the two and a half decades that hinckley has been at st. elizabeths hospital in washington to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility there has not been a single act of violence.since 1999 levine said hinckley has been taking a drug called risperdal. medical websites describe risperdal as an antipsychotic medication often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.dr. tyler jones director of psychiatry at st. elizabeths testified hinckley also started taking zoloft in 2005 after complaining about anxiety.jones said hinckley had been diagnosed years ago as suffering from depression and from an unspecified psychotic disorder. but jones said hes been in remission for both of those disorders for many years. he said hinckley also suffers from narcissism which has improved but is still present. jones said he has interviewed hinckley but has not treated him.according to jones hinckleys treatment team was informed by the secret service that hinckley had not told the truth about his activities during several visits. jones said the medical staff discussed this issue with hinckley who initially did not appear to view the issue as a big deal but later understood it was a serious issue.although concerned hinckley was not truthful about his activities jones said we didnt feel this constituted an increased risk. the staff decided to reduce hinckleys christmas visit to his mother from 10 days to five days and he will not be allowed to have any unaccompanied activities during that december stay. jones said the staff had considered stronger action including the possibility of revoking hinckleys privileges altogether.a september filing by prosecutors said hinckley continues to be deceptive regarding his relationships with and interest in women. according to the document in june of 2009 he went on the internet to find photos of his female dentist. when he was caught hinckley claimed falsely that the dentist had invited him to view her personal photographs.asked about the photographs of the dentist jones said the photographs were of the woman graduating from dental school and were not salacious.he said the hospital considers hinckley a low risk of violence to himself and others.currently hinckley is allowed to visit his mother 10 days a month. on july 29 st. elizabeths hospital filed a proposal to increase that. the first step would allow hinckley to have two visits of 17 days. that would be followed by six visits of 24 days.according to the september government filing opposing the plan the hospital would then be given the sole discretion to place hinckley on convalescent leave in his mothers hometown.after the judge and all the lawyers were in place hinckley now 56 entered the court wearing a brown sports jacket dark pants and a striped tie. he shook hands with all his lawyers and sat down. u.s. district judge paul friedman greeted hinckley and he replied saying good morning.hinckleys defense team has listed him as a possible witness at the proceedings but has not revealed if he will definitely testify. prosecutors want to crossexamine hinckley and his defense lawyers oppose that.mental health experts and secret service agents will testify along with hinckleys brother and sister. hinckleys mother is now 85 years old and is not a scheduled witness.its not clear how quickly the judge might issue a ruling on the hospitals plan to gradually allow hinckley greater freedom.on march 30 1981 hinckley waited for president reagan to leave a washington hotel after a speech. he opened fire and hit reagan his press secretary james brady secret service agent timothy mccarthy and washington police officer thomas delahanty. all survived but brady suffered a serious head wound that permanently affected his mobility and his speech.hinckley who was 25 at the time of the shooting was enamored of actress jodie foster. he left a letter addressed to her in his washington hotel room saying dear jodie. there is a definite possibility i will be killed in my attempt to get reagan.defense attorneys want john hinckley to be transitioned out of a mental hospitalthe hospital doesnt know what mr. hinckley is thinking the prosecutor saysthe hearing may determine whether to eventually free him from a mental hospitalafter john hinckley shot reagan he was found not guilty by reason of insanity",

                    "context": "cnn  four groups that advocate for immigrant rights said thursday they will challenge arizonas new immigration law which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal u.s. residency.the mexican american legal defense and educational fund the american civil liberties union the aclu of arizona and the national immigration law center held a news conference thursday in phoenix to announce the legal challenge.the arizona community can be assured that a vigorous and sophisticated legal challenge will be mounted in advance of sb1070s implementation seeking to prevent this unconstitutional and discriminatory law from ever taking effect said thomas a. saenz president of the mexican american legal defense and educational fund known as maldef.this law will only make the rampant racial profiling of latinos that is already going on in arizona much worse said alessandra soler meetze executive director of the aclu of arizona. if this law were implemented citizens would effectively have to carry their papers at all times to avoid arrest. it is a low point in modern america when a state law requires police to demand documents from people on the street.republican arizona gov. jan brewer signed the law last week. it goes into effect 90 days after the close of the legislative session which has not been determined.brewer and others who support the law say it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts.racial profiling is illegal brewer said after signing the bill friday. it is illegal in america and its certainly illegal in arizona.the national coalition of latino clergy & christian leaders said sunday it also planned legal action.our churches and pastors in arizona are outraged about the significant threat this antiimmigrant law will have in the lives of arizonas latinos said the rev. miguel rivera the groups chairman.this policy violates the rights of american citizens particularly the fastgrowing latino population of arizona by eliminating the basic right of due process which we are certain that the courts will agree rivera said.the law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect theyre in the united states illegally. the measure makes it a state crime to live or travel through arizona illegally.it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them.in addition to signing the law brewer also issued an executive order that requires training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination.this training will include what does and does not constitute reasonable suspicion that a person is not legally present in the united states she said.some officials in arizona have expressed their displeasure with the measure. phoenix mayor phil gordon said thursday that he is very disappointed.he said he is concerned that calls to boycott arizona businesses and tourism will harm the state.im very incredulous that our state leaders  our socalled leaders  have allowed our state to be split when were suffering economic hardships gordon told cnn.other critics say the bill is unconstitutional and will trample residents civil rights.quite simply this law is a civil rights disaster and an insult to american values said mary bauer legal director of the southern poverty law center. no one in our country should be required to produce their papers or demand to prove their innocence. what kind of country are we becoming?but a national republican leader said thursday that arizona is just filling a void left by the federal government.i think the people of arizona have a right to pass their laws under the 10th amendment house minority leader john boehner said. i think it is clearly a result of the federal governments failure to secure our border and to enforce our laws.gordon said the real solution is comprehensive immigration reform that would allow more immigrants to legally enter the united states.this law doesnt accomplish that he said. it doesnt do anything on that.president obama has called on congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law this year. cnn has learned that senate majority leader harry reid and other top democratic senators will unveil the outlines of that legislation late thursday.but boehner said at a briefing thursday that theres not a chance that congress will approve the measure this year especially after the recent passage of a health care reform bill.ive been out here for a little while and know that in the middle of an election year after weve had bills like health care shoved down our throats and the process twisted tortured pressured bribed you cannot do a serious piece of legislation of this size with this difficulty in this environment he said. and its nothing more than a cynical ploy to try and engage voters some segment of voters to show up in this novembers elections.the arizona measure has drawn sharp criticism from the mexican government which issued an advisory to its citizens this week. the secretary general of the organization of american states and some member states also expressed concerns about the law wednesday.this is an issue of concern to all citizens of the americas beginning with the citizens of the united states a country with a very rich tradition of immigration and respect for immigrants who have come to lead a better life oas secretary general jose miguel insulza said. the rich tradition we all admire of recognizing immigrants in the united states has been harmed undermined.the uproar caused by the law has even spread to the nations pastime. protesters plan to demonstrate against the arizona diamondbacks baseball team thursday outside wrigley field in chicago illinois.in arizona two popular singers also will voice their opposition.grammy awardwinning colombian singer shakira is scheduled to meet with gordon on thursday evening.singersongwriter linda ronstadt an arizona native of mexican and german descent also attended the thursday afternoon rally with the immigrant rights groups.what gov. brewer signed into law last week is a piece of legislation that threatens the very heart of this great state ronstadt said. we must come together and stop sb1070 from pitting neighbor against neighbor to the detriment of us all.federal officials estimate there are about 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the united states of which about 6.6 million come from mexico and 760000 from the rest of latin america. about 1 million come from asia.arizona which is on the mexican border has about 460000 undocumented immigrants the federal government says. at least five other states including california with 2.6 million have more undocumented immigrants the government says.the other states with more illegal immigrants than arizona are texas florida new york and georgia.a pew research center survey late last year found that americans believe latinos are discriminated against more than any other major racial or ethnic group in american society.the pew survey also indicated that about onethird of the nations latinos say they or someone they know has experienced discrimination. about 9 percent said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status in the year before the survey.fiftyseven percent of those surveyed said they worried that they a family member or a close friend could be deported.new 4 groups announce legal challenge in phoenixamerican

supporters say it doesnt involve any illegal acts",
