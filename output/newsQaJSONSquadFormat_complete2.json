is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government.i have to say that i cant believe this. i really cant believe this tutu said. you have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here.the dalai lama scrapped his planned trip to south africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time his spokesman said.visa

his decision according to spokesman clayson monyela who said the visa application was still under consideration.the dalai lama had been invited to the country to receive the mahatma gandhi international award for peace and reconciliation and to speak at a number of events including a lecture in honor of tutus 80th birthday. tutu and the dalai lama are recipients of the nobel peace

separation that was present in south africa until 1994.you are disgraceful tutu said about the government. you are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood.the

tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference saying it was not in the countrys interest for him to attend.in refusing the 2009 application south africa said that if the dalai lama attended the conference the focus would shift away from the 2010 world cup the global soccer championship it was hosting.we cannot allow focus to shift to china and tibet presidential spokesman thabo masebe said adding that south africa had gained much from its trading relationship with china.the dalai lama fled tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against chinese rule and china pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy.speculation surfaced tuesday that this years visit was also affected by south africas relationship with china.south african vice president kgalema motlanthe visited beijing last week and met with chinese president hu jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties.motlanthe said south africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage according to the official chinese news agency xinhua.but monyela said the application had nothing to do with china.we are a sovereign nation which

their own ears both in poland and in the vatican karol wojtyla flagellated himself the book says using the name the pope was given at birth.in the closet among the cloaks a particular pantbelt hung from a hook which he utilized as a whip and one which he always had brought to castel gandolfo the book says.the book was written by a vatican insider slawomir oder with italian journalist saverio gaeta of the catholic weekly christian family. oder is head of the vatican committee investigating whether john paul ii should be declared a saint. john paul died in 2005.the evil albino monk in dan browns the da vinci code may be the bestknown example of selfflagellation these days but the practice is not unusual in catholicism  or nearly as extreme as it is shown in the movie.when members or former members [of opus dei] see the monk go at it in the movie they just burst out laughing its so nutty said the rev. michael barrett a priest of the catholic opus dei sect.in actual catholic selfflagellation there is no blood no injury nothing to harm a persons health nothing traumatic. if it caused any harm the church would not allow it he wrote on opus deis web site when the movie came out in 2006.this voluntarily accepted discomfort is a way of joining oneself to jesus christ and the sufferings he voluntarily accepted in order to redeem us from sin. the da vinci codes masochist monk who loves pain for its own sake has nothing to do with real christian mortification barrett said.mother teresa is among famous catholics who selfflagellated in some way barrett said.catholics are not alone in choosing to inflict pain on themselves for religion reasons. some shiite muslims lash themselves until they bleed when marking the mourning period of ashura while fasting is practiced by people in several religions including jews on yom kippur the day of atonement.david gibson a journalist who worked for vatican radio when john paul ii was pope pointed out that the pontiff wrote an apostolic letter  essentially a papal position paper  on suffering in 1984.christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. he said very clearly if any man would come after me ... let him take up his cross daily  the pope wrote quoting the gospel of luke.jesus the pope wrote suffered in place of man and for man. every man has his own share in the redemption. each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the redemption was accomplished.in bringing about the redemption through suffering christ has also raised human suffering to the level of the redemption. thus each man in his suffering can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of christ says the letter salvifici doloris on the christian meaning of human suffering.john paul was a product of a very old world polish catholicism said gibson who now writes on religion for politics daily.he was a very disciplined man and a very rigorous man in his personal spirituality he said.the authors of the new book clearly approve of any whipping the pope did of himself he added.even though its going to weird people out its obviously seen by his postulators as a sign of his holiness he said using the technical term for the person who investigates a persons qualifications for sainthood.he said the idea is not as bizarre as it might sound to contemporary ears.the idea of fasting renouncing something giving up your starbucks latte so you can send money to haiti  you cant simply look down your nose at it without rejecting a lot of other ideas about selfsacrifice he said.the authors of the book

other innocent victims. by dressing in a wehrmacht uniform you are expressing totally unwarranted support and nostalgia for an army which committed the most terrible war crimes and acts of genocide the letter said.it would hard to adequately describe the depth of the pain that your appearance caused not only to jews and other victims of nazism but to any person of moral integrity who knows the history of world war ii zuroff wrote.zuroff told cnn he did not expect mazare to resign or even to respond to the letter.but he said he hoped the mayor might act on zuroffs suggestion that mazare create a romanianlanguage edition of an acclaimed exhibition on the crimes of the wehrmacht.the nazi uniform incident which took place sunday was the first time zuroff heard of mazare he said.he has a history of being outrageous but his antics have never included something that i would deal with zuroff said.hes a real character apparently. hes also very popular which makes this much more difficult.cnn attempts to contact mazare were unsuccessful.romania was a nazi ally from 1940 to 1944 under the leadership of a rightwing military government led by general ion antonescu.at least 270000 romanian jews were killed or died from mistreatment during the holocaust according to the holocaust encyclopedia.the 1930 romanian census recorded 728115 people who identified themselves as jewish comprising approximately 4 percent of the population the reference work says.antonescu was deposed in 1944 and romania switched sides in world war ii.jewish organizations call for a romanian

to carry fabric on your back you need to learn how to cut and sew. the fame is going to come later.more known for his expert draping techniques yigal azrouël taught students more than how to

confronted with the prospect of a palestinian bid for full u.n. membership u.s. president barack obama issued a sharp rebuke wednesday to those pressing for statehood  a rebuke likely to bring criticism from the arab world.peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the u.n. obama said addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of u.n. general assembly. if it were that easy it would have been accomplished by now.the united states has vowed to block a palestinian membership application should it reach the security council but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an american veto  a move widely seen as unpopular across the middle east.a formal request for full u.n. membership is expected to be submitted friday.one year ago i stood at this podium and called for an independent palestine obama added. i believed then  and i believe now  that the palestinian people deserve a state of their own. but what i also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between israelis and palestinians themselves.a year later despite extensive u.s. efforts the parties have not bridged their differences obama said.the american president met with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and declared the bonds between their two countries unbreakable a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile u.s. political landscape.though netanyahu was not in attendance at the general assembly during obamas speech he called the u.s. position a badge of honor and has pushed for a resumption of talks beginning in new york and continuing in ramallah and jerusalem.peace negotiations broke down last year.palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas met with obama later wednesday part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move. obama reiterated his stance on the need for a twostate solution officials said.abbas met earlier with u.n. secretarygeneral ban kimoon who promised the request would be taken very seriously according to nabeel shaath a senior negotiator for the palestine liberation organization. shaath told cnn it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the u.n. secretarygeneral before or after abbas addresses the general assembly early friday afternoon.ban said it will not take long to get security council consideration.shaath added that settling for a lesser status  such as being recognized as a nonmember state  is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked. but the palestinians do not want anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness he said.palestinians current status at the united nations is as an observer entity. observers can speak in the general assembly but not vote.while a veto by the united states in the security council would block any effort to gain full u.n. membership a yes vote in the general assembly  where only a majority would be needed  would raise palestinians to the status of permanent observer state the status the vatican currently holds.abbas effort to gain u.n. recognition of a palestinian state is opposed by hamas the palestinian organization that controls gaza. it has warned abbas against making the request saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with israel which would deprive the palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland.as national leaders took to rostrum wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security attention at the u.n. general assembly seemed to center on the potential membership bid.french president nicolas sarkozy urged the body to recognize palestine as a nonmember state calling for a more definitive timetable for israelipalestinian peace talks. but he also warned that a u.s. veto of the bid for full membership in the security council could be dangerous and might spark violence.argentinean president cristina fernandez de kirchner seemed to agree adding that noninclusion of palestine at the united nations this year will create greater insecurity.the palestinian leader said he will personally deliver the application to the u.n. security council but does not expect the body to act immediately according to palestinian officials.they say abbas is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves new york on friday but added that he will give both the united nations and american leadership several weeks to respond to the letter  temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown.abbas will wait for a response from the diplomatic quartet on the middle east the officials said and then return to the u.n. general assembly to negotiate statehood recognition working through the u.n. security council.abbas goal according to the officials is to legitimize palestinian statehood by eventually forcing a vote.brazilian president dilma rousseff who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assemblys 66th session joined the chorus of voices on wednesday calling on the council to approve the palestinian bid.her speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as the century of women.also wednesday obama pressed turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan  an increasingly vocal critic of israel  to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship officials said.the u.n. chief meanwhile also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases empowering women

what do they want future generations to know about it? challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now describing the event and its significance for all americans. combine the letters into a book or a web site or create a video of students reading their letters. present the finished product to your schools historian or media specialist for archiving.2. covering black historyask students what if cnn correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? organize students into small teams of reporters and have each team select a time period in american history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for africanamericans. then have students imagine that cnn was there to cover the historical figure or event. ask how do you think that cnn reporters might have covered these stories? encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. after students have presented their scripts have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time.3. harlem renaissanceinform students that during the 1920s and 1930s an africanamerican cultural movement occurred in the united states that was known as the harlem renaissance. it was a literary musical and artistic explosion that was born in harlem new york and it had a profound impact on africanamerican culture and on the u.s. as a whole. have your class host a harlem renaissance cultural fair. direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement.have each student select one of these africanamerican artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. have students serve as roaming curators to instruct and interest guests in the harlem renaissance and the creative works of these great africanamericans.4. profiles in black historydo your students show a personal interest in science music politics theater sports or education? inspire them to celebrate the contributions of africanamericans by having them write profiles of africanamericans in the categories that interest them. for example a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm all of whom were/are africanamericans. direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. then encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. in their presentations students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. post the designs around the classroom.5. local africanamerican historyvaluable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries historical organizations universities or colleges and online. encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black americans in their city or town. students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. they may also decide to profile influential black community members. have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.6. black history museumcelebrate black history by creating plans for a local black history museum. first have students decide where the museum should be housed. suggestions might include a school or local library an exhibit in an existing history museum or perhaps a virtual online museum. next discuss how the museum should be organized. students may choose to categorize the content by theme by specific time periods by specific dates by people or by local landmarks. encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. then challenge students to consider what people events or contributions to include in their black history museum. ask what messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits?7. not just for februaryinform students that while dr. carter g. woodson chose the month of february to recognize the accomplishments of africanamericans black history can be celebrated all year long. challenge students to create yearlong calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of africanamerican newsmakers illustrate key events in black history and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.standardssocial studiesii. time continuity and changesocial studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of the ways human beings view themselves in and over time.v. individuals groups and institutionssocial studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of interactions among individuals groups and institutions.the curriculum standards for social studies http//www.socialstudies.org/standards/strands/ are published by the national council for social studies http//www.socialstudies.org/.resourcescnn  black in america 2http//www..com/specials/2009/black.in.america/u.s. census bureau black africanamerican history month february 2010http//www.census.gov/pressrelease/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/014487.htmlfebruary is black history monththese questions and activities help students learn about the history culture and achievements of africanamericansthese questions and activities can be adapted to accommodate students of different grade levels and learning styles", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 644, "text": "your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans.\\n\\n1.

people who may have come into contact with them.oakleys attorney herb moncier said outside court thursday that oakleys job was to break rods into little pieces and throw them away. moncier said oakley had a security clearance but moncier did not believe it was a highlevel clearance.the government alleges that in january oakley attempted to sell the pieces of scrap to someone he thought was a french agent  but in reality was an undercover fbi agent moncier said. he said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an appliance under the law.mr. oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months said moncier who added that he had traveled to washington for work on the case.each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250000 fine.while none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology
