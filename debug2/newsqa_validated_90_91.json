One of the messages in her inbox was from an acquaintance she'd been corresponding with since their 50th high school reunion last year.    In a survey of 4,000 people, about a third said they had accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person.    But this e-mail last June didn't contain chummy banter or reminiscences. It simply included a lewd photo of a partly unclothed young man. The file name of the picture was \"Mid East Hottie.\"    \"I was shocked!\" says Dunetz, 68. She hastily closed the e-mail and tried to erase the image from her mind.    Later that day, the sender e-mailed an apology to her and two dozen others who had received the e-mail. He explained he'd been experimenting with his new computer and was trying to figure out how to add attachments to an e-mail, Dunetz says. In doing so, he attached an image from his desktop and tried to send it to himself. Instead, the e-mail program automatically filled in an entire group from his address book -- something he apparently didn't realize until after he hit the \"send\" button.    \"I felt terrible for him,\" Dunetz says. \"I could imagine just how mortified he must have been.\"    With some 55 billion e-mails being sent daily (not including spam), according to e-mail archiving company The Radicati Group, misdirected e-mails have become the online equivalent of a wrong number. They're unavoidable, annoying -- and often embarrassing.    The 'uh-oh' e-mail    In a recent online survey conducted by AOL, 32 percent of the 4,000 respondents have at one time or another mistakenly forwarded an e-mail to an unintended recipient. And often, it's something not so nice.    Karla Comer, an account executive at an ad agency in Greensboro, North Carolina, knows just how embarrassing that can be. In 2004, Comer met a guy at a concert and went out with him a few times, but ultimately realized she wasn't interested. \"He was just awkward and clumsy. And sometimes I'd catch him staring at me, which really creeped me out,\" she says.    She tried to end the relationship by simply not returning his phone calls. \"But then he e-mailed and casually said that he had not heard from me in a while and he hoped everything was fine but just assumed I was busy,\" says Comer, 31.    \"Before I returned his e-mail, I sent the message to a close girlfriend with a blurb about what an idiot I thought he was and that dating him was a bad idea because he had no understanding of social cues.\"    She thought she sent the \"he's an idiot\" e-mail only to her girlfriend.    To her horror, Comer says, the spurned beau replied a few minutes later, calling her some not-so-sweet names and suggesting that she \"share THIS e-mail with your friends.\"    \"I was speechless,\" says Comer, who chose to not respond. \"But eventually I was able to laugh at it.\"    When errant e-mails are sent at work, however, there's often much more at stake than personal embarrassment.    Three years ago, Jamie Diamond, 33, e-mailed his then-boss to ask about a client at the public relations firm where he was working. His boss wrote back, criticizing the client as incompetent and urging Diamond to \"go around him if you want to get anything done.\"    Unfortunately, Diamond says, she also sent the e-mail to the client -- oops, make that ex-client.    \"One click, and suddenly we'd lost a $5 million account,\" says Diamond, who is now self-employed as a publicist in Williams, Oregon.    Can you turn back time?    Short of erasing someone's memory, there is no surefire way to retrieve a missent e-mail. Microsoft Outlook has a \"recall\" function that can erase unread e-mails from the in-box of the recipient -- as long as the recipient is using the same mail client or server as the sender -- as does AOL, but only for messages between AOL users. (Both AOL and CNN are divisions of Time Warner.)    Then there's BigString.com, an e-mail service which lets you tinker with (or even erase) messages that have already been sent by having the sender write e-mails that are created, stored and viewed on a remote server, where they can be edited or revoked at any time; recipients are actually accessing the e-mail on the remote server when they read the message, even though it looks like a regular e-mail.    But old-fashioned vigilance is probably the best way to avert these snafus in the first place. Roger Matus, CEO of e-mail archiving company InBoxer Inc. and keeper of the blog Death By Email, believes the easiest way to avoid these mistakes is to forget that the \"reply all\" button even exists. \"Simply put, there is rarely a real reason to use it,\" he says. \"Often, when you hit it, you end up e-mailing people who were blind carbon copied without realizing.\"    Matus offers the following tips on avoiding e-mail embarrassment:    \u2022 Type out the person's full name when addressing your e-mail. If you type just the first few letters and let your e-mail program fill out the rest based on your address book, it could easily misroute your message without your realizing it.    \u2022 Double-check the addresses of your intended recipients before you hit \"send.\" Do you really want all the people to get this particular message?    \u2022 Be sure to notify your company's legal department if there is any chance that governance, compliance or privacy regulations were violated as a result of something you sent by mistake.    \u2022 Immediately notify the person who received the e-mail that it was a mistake and, if possible, ask them not to read the message -- or at least to delete it right away.

CNN's Gary Tuchman accompanied a Border Patrol unit in Nogales, Arizona, and experienced the variety and the danger of law enforcement life firsthand.    CNN's Gary Tuchman pulls his weight on ride-along with 64 lbs. of marijuana seized by law enforcement.    NOGALES, Arizona (CNN) -- Nogales, Arizona, is a small city. Just more than 20,000 people live here, according to the 2005 census. But spend a couple of days here with law enforcement, and your head will spin.    Almost half of all illegal drugs seized from Mexico last year were seized in the eastern Arizona region, and Nogales is the largest border city in this U.S. border patrol sector.    In the past six months, the Border Patrol has seized about 500,000 pounds of illegal drugs here, which is 15 percent higher than the previous six months. Each day, hundreds of people are arrested, mostly for immigration violations but many for drug and weapons crimes. The temporary jail cells in the Border Patrol station in Nogales are often overflowing. The Border Patrol boss in this sector says his agents were assaulted 260 times within the past year.    One night this week, we saw the danger and variety of lawbreaking activity experienced here quite vividly.    At the immigration checkpoint set up a half-hour north of Nogales on Interstate 19, a semi truck is pulled over when the drug-sniffing dog detects something. The back of the truck is opened, and inside are thousands of tomatoes, but the dog is still not happy.    The truck is taken back to the Border Patrol station, and agents climb over the tomatoes. And that's where they find the stash. Bales and bales of dope. Forty bales of marijuana. Nine hundred eight pounds, to be exact. At a street value of $800 a pound, the authorities estimate they kept $720,000 worth of marijuana off the streets.    I interview the man arrested for driving the shipment. The operating theory: that he is doing dirty work for one of the Mexican cartels. But the Mexican man tells me he is not scared, because \"I was just carrying tomatoes.\" He claims that he knew nothing about the nearly half-ton of pot. The man will be telling that to the judge and could face significant time in an American prison.    Illegal drugs consume the day of all law enforcement people here.    We drive with the Border Patrol in the late hours of the night and hear a call over the radio that two men have been spotted jumping the border wall with backpacks.    The chase is on, and another dog is brought to the area. The men disappear, but the dog picks up a scent in the heavy, hilly brush. Sarah the drug-sniffing dog is taught to sit when she finds something.    She suddenly sits and then jumps on what looks like bushes. It turns out the bushes are actually attached to sacks of marijuana. Two 25-pound sacks full of pot.    They were abandoned by the men when they ran away after being spotted. Street value, at least $40,000.    Ray Rivera, the agent who works with Sarah, told me that over the past two years, Sarah has found nearly 7,000 pounds of pot. But Rivera also is pretty heroic. Just a couple of weeks ago, he was shot in the leg when a man he was chasing committed suicide. The bullet passed through the man's face and into Rivera's knee. Law enforcement life here is not for the squeamish.    Before we leave this area, we go to a rural area west of Nogales where we hear illegal immigrants and drug couriers often try to get into the United States. When we get there, we see why. The tall border fence abruptly ends as it gets close to a small mountain, but there is plenty of space for people to squeeze into the United States.    We wander about 10 feet into Mexico to look at some of the clothes, water bottles and cigarette boxes that people have left behind. As we get ready to leave, we see a Border Patrol vehicle zooming towards us. They don't know we're with CNN; they think we may be criminals.    One of the four agents points his rifle at us and demands that we keep our hands in plain sight. They search our car, and we tell them who we are and what we're doing. They say they spotted us because of their long-range video cameras. They tell us to give them a heads up next time we go exploring, and all is well.    The agents did their job well. But there are only so many of them and an immense amount of border. After spending time with these agents, it's easy to see how sometimes what they do feels like a thankless task."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/97a2268d2d628d4098fe1625cda7d1f02abd1f54.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is buried there", "id": "107679", "answers": [{"text": "Emmett Till,", "answer_start": 2116}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "ALSIP, Illinois (CNN) -- Four people face felony charges after authorities discovered that hundreds of graves were dug up and allegedly resold at a historic African-American cemetery near Chicago, Illinois, authorities said Thursday.    Dozens of graves at Burr Oak Cemetery were desecrated by workers as part of a financial scheme, authorities say.    Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said the four would resell the plots in Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, excavate the graves, dump the remains and pocket the cash.    \"This was not done in a very, very delicate way, folks,\" he told reporters at a news conference Thursday.    \"They would excavate a grave and would proceed to dump the remains wherever they found a place to do it in the back of the cemetery. This was not moving graves; this was not replacing graves; this was dumping of them.\"    In some cases, graves were stacked on top of each other, they \"literally pounded the other one down,\" Dart said. In all about 300 graves may have been dug up in the cemetery, he said.    Authorities identified those charged as Carolyn Towns, an office manager for the cemetery; and Keith Nicks, Terrance Nicks and Maurice Daley, all gravediggers.    Each has been charged with dismembering a human body, a felony charge for which sentences range from 6 to 30 years, Anita Alvarez, Cook County state's attorney, said at the news conference.    Steven Watkins, an attorney for Towns, said his client is innocent. \"Somebody is apparently making false accusations against my client,\" he said. \"She's maintaining her innocence.\"    The Cook County state attorney's office said the other three charged were being represented by the public defender's office, and a message left at that office was not immediately returned.    Bail was set at $250,000 for Towns and $200,000 for the other three, Alvarez said. None had posted bail by late afternoon Thursday, the sheriff's department said.  Watch officials announce the charges \u00bb    It was not immediately known if the four had legal counsel.    Authorities began investigating the cemetery -- where, among others, lynching victim Emmett Till, blues legend Dinah Washington and some Negro League baseball players are buried -- about six weeks ago after receiving a call from its owners who had concerns about possible \"financial irregularities\" regarding the business, Dart told CNN earlier this week.    \"This crime, it's a whole new dimension,\" Alvarez said. Authorities also suspect that Towns pretended to set up a memorial fund for Till and pocketed the funds, Dart said.  Watch sheriff discuss gruesome revelation \u00bb    He told CNN that groundskeepers, who have not been implicated in the scheme, have said that the grave of Till -- whose 1955 lynching at age 14 helped spark the civil rights movement -- has not been disturbed.    The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was also at the news conference, noted the high-profile names of some of those buried in the cemetery, but said, \"everybody here is special, and every family has special needs and special hurt, special grief.\"    Most of the excavations occurred in back lots, where the plots were older and not frequently visited, Dart said earlier this week. However, other plots may have been disturbed, as well.    The cemetery's current owners, who could not be reached by CNN for comment, have operated it for more than five years but are not believed to be involved in the alleged scam, Dart said.    He said the workers may have doctored records to cover their tracks and noted that the cemetery holds all the records of who is buried and where.    \"There's virtually no regulations whatsoever (for cemeteries),\" Dart said. \"Most all of the documents and everything are housed here.\"    Investigators are trying to determine the scope of the alleged scheme and plan to use thermal-imaging devices to further examine other graves to see if they have been tampered with, Dart said.    The FBI, forensic scientists and local funeral directors have been called in to help in the investigation, he said.    \"I don't even know what to tell you about the heartbreaking stories that I've been hearing from people, crying hysterically that they're going through the burial for the second time today,\" he said.    \"And they're looking for answers and we're sitting there telling them, 'This is going to be very difficult,\" he said. \"We're trying to bring closure, but it's going to take a long time to do that.\"    CNN's Katherine Wojtecki and Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4be65bc748e0700cfd5a6b43cb9801c8cd573bc6.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many people did the floods and landslides kill?", "id": "107681", "answers": [{"text": "at least 100", "answer_start": 87}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Flash floods and landslides triggered by a weekend tropical storm have killed at least 100 people in Vietnam, the country's news agency said Monday.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN's \"American Morning\" on Monday that officials would review how anti-terrorist watch lists are maintained.      Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who is accused of trying to blow up a flight carrying 300 passengers, was on a general list that contained 550,000 other names, but he was still allowed to travel to the United States.      A senior administration official said the suspect was not on a no-fly list because \"the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no-fly list.\"      \"Under the existing protocols, it requires an interagency process and the identification of other negative information that's credible ... and that process whittles down from 500,000 [names] or so that are on the generic list to the fewer than 5,000 that are on the no-fly list,\" Napolitano said. \"We are going to be looking at that process and how those lists are created, maintained, updated, exchanged and the like, because clearly this individual should not have been able to board this plane carrying that material.\"      AbdulMutallab is accused of trying to blow up a Northwest flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day.      Officials say he carried an explosive device that contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate, an explosive also known as PETN. Part of the device, which failed to detonate, was sewn into his underwear, a law enforcement official said Monday.      President Obama, in his first public comment since the incident, said Monday that screening and security procedures for all flights were immediately enhanced, including an increase in the number of air marshals on international flights.      The federal system for tracking potential terrorism suspects will be reviewed because the latest incident showed that it had possible failings, the president said.      All screening policies, technologies and procedures for air travel will be reviewed \"to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks,\" Obama said.      A Department of Homeland Security official who asked not to be identified said Sunday that the ranks of the air marshals have been increased by cutting vacations and leave, and by pulling in marshals from instructional and administrative posts.      On CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Napolitano said air marshals are assigned randomly to flights.      Current and former marshals contacted by CNN took exception to Napolitano's claims, saying that although there is an element of randomness to increase unpredictability, the assignments of air marshals are largely based on intelligence and an analysis of which flights are most vulnerable or most attractive to terrorists.      Despite a possible tragedy, Napolitano said the response system worked, as passengers and crew avoided panic and subdued the suspect while authorities notified other flights in the air of the situation and kept the air transport system operating.      \"Once the incident happened, we were able to immediately notify the 128 flights in the air, as well as airports on the ground domestically, internationally, our law enforcement partners, other allies, institute immediate safe procedures to make sure that this could not happen on other flights and that people were watching out for it on other flights, even as we focused on what went wrong prior to this one,\" Napolitano added Monday.      The Transportation Security Administration invoked a \"one hour rule\" after the thwarted attack, which prohibited passengers on international U.S.-bound flights from leaving their seats during the last hour of a flight, sources said. In addition, passengers had to stow pillows and blankets, and maps viewed on in-flight entertainment screens were disabled during the final hour of flight.      The TSA has modified the rule, however, giving airlines and crews discretion over implementation, sources said.

Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans.  Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds.  Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend.  News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days.  Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris.  Gallo Records called the death \"senseless and random,\" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was.  South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked.  \"It's very sad,\" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. \"He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists.\"  Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York.  His record company said Dube leaves \"a great void\" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans.  Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named \"Lucky\" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies.  Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career.  Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss.  \"Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,\" Haarburger said. \"It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically.\"  Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle.

The woman involved -- Mandi Hamlin -- told reporters earlier Friday she was humiliated by last month's incident, in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male TSA officers nearby. The incident occurred at the Lubbock, Texas, airport.    The officers \"rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved,\" the TSA said in a statement posted on its Web site Friday afternoon. \"TSA supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing Lubbock that day.\"    However, \"TSA has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed,\" the statement said. \"In the future, TSA will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question.\"    Hamlin and her lawyer, celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, said they want a public apology from the agency, as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect.    Allred pointed out that TSA's Web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said Hamlin was never offered.    \"The conduct of TSA was cruel and unnecessary,\" Allred told reporters at a news conference. \"Last time that I checked, a nipple was not a dangerous weapon.\"    She said if an apology was not forthcoming, \"Mandi is going to have to consider her legal options.\"    Attempts by CNN to reach Allred for a response to the TSA statement Friday afternoon were unsuccessful.    TSA said in its statement it acknowledges \"that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets (the) situation in which she found herself. We appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.\"    The incident occurred February 24 as Hamlin, 37, was preparing to fly to Dallas-Fort Worth from Lubbock, where she had been visiting her elderly great-uncle.    Hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport.    She did not set off the metal detector at Lubbock International Airport, but was pulled to the side for additional screening, Allred said. A hand wand used by a TSA officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts.    Hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, Allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them.    \"Ms. Hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings,\" Allred said, reading from a letter she sent TSA. \"After nipple rings are inserted, the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove. In addition, once removed, the pierced skin may close up almost immediately, making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing.\"    More officers were called over, and the group grew to four male and two female TSA officers, according to Hamlin. Also, a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather. The officers insisted that Hamlin remove the nipple rings, Allred said.    \"She felt humiliated by the scene that the TSA officers were making,\" Allred said.    \"With tears streaming down her face, she again asked to show the piercings to a TSA officer instead of having to remove them. She was told, however, she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them. Had she been told that she had a right to a pat-down, she would have chosen that option.\"    She eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings, Allred said. One came out easily, but the other would not, and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers. She was handed a large pair, Allred said.    \"As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing, behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male TSA officers snickering in the background,\" Allred said in the letter.    \"Mandi Hamlin was publicly humiliated. ... Clearly, this is not how passengers should be treated.\"  Watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry \u00bb    Afterward, Hamlin underwent another scan, but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring. She offered to remove it, Allred said, but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it. Hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed, Allred said.    \"I wouldn't wish this experience upon anyone,\" Hamlin told reporters. \"I felt surprised, embarrassed, humiliated and scared. No one deserves to go through this.\"    In a statement earlier Friday, the TSA said it \"is well aware of terrorists' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body. Therefore, we have a duty to the American public to resolve any alarm that we discover.\"    TSA included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a \"bra bomb\" in training and testing its officers.    Hamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted, and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed.    \"People who are pierced should not be snickered at, should not become the object of ridicule, should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment,\" Allred said. \"They should be respected just like everybody else.\"    She said she had received a call from TSA's public affairs office Friday morning. \"We hope that means they're going to jump on this and do something about it,\" she said. \"We want TSA to do the right thing now. We're going to give them the opportunity.\"    Hamlin said she will continue to fly but will avoid the Lubbock airport. The next time she visits her great-uncle, she said, \"I will be driving.\" E-mail to a friend    CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/023efd2b40b245ffca3a19cebc20f7a6da311454.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what were amplified?", "id": "107694", "answers": [{"text": "set of recollections", "answer_start": 1227}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James.      Leicester Stovell alleges that the athlete and his family have been involved in a cover-up to deny paternity by committing fraud and misrepresentation. He told HLN's \"Prime News\" on Thursday that he wants \"a carefully structured and secure DNA test\" to prove he's the NBA all-star's father.      Stovell says he has been trying for three years to establish paternity and is seeking $4 million in damages. An earlier test ruled out the possibility, but he said the test could have been tampered with -- \"and there are indications that there was a motivation.\"      Stovell said he had sex with James' mother, Gloria James, after meeting at a Washington bar while she was visiting from Ohio in 1984. A few months later, she told him she was pregnant, but did not say whether he was the father.      Stovell said his only request was that the child, if a boy, play basketball. He said his memory of the encounter resurfaced more than 20 years later, \"after being asked whether I had a son, and I then systematically explored all of my past for that possibility.\"      \"I came across this set of recollections and in focusing on them, they amplified,\" he said.      In the complaint, filed June 23, Stovell says, \"I recently have concluded that a comprehensive, sophisticated and well-funded effort might well have been underway for quite some time, perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant LeBron James was in high school, to frustrate identification of his real father, and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me.\"      He stopped short of saying he is certain he is James' father. \"I don't want to make such a definitive statement in the absence of corroborative evidence\" such as DNA, he said.      Stovell said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire. \"I have some limitation considerations that caused me to want to file the suit before the end of June,\" he said.      He denied the timing had anything to do with the current LeBron mania.      James is scheduled to announce Thursday evening the team he has chosen to play for next season, a deal worth perhaps tens of millions of dollars or more. He currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers.      He says he was informed by Gloria James months later that she was pregnant. He claims she told him the child would be named LeBron, similar to Leicester Bryce, Stovell's first and middle names.      The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter, but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s.      Stovell is a solo legal practitioner in the District of Columbia, and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf. A call to LeBron James' attorney, Frederick Nance of Cleveland, Ohio, was not immediately returned.      The lawsuit had been filed without much initial publicity, but was reported by the TMZ celebrity website Wednesday.      Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency, alleging racial discrimination. Federal court records show the case was settled when the commission paid him $230,000, while not admitting fault.

Jennifer Schuett, 27, was abducted and left for dead at age 8. A suspect was arrested Tuesday.    Now begins another chapter in Schuett's 19-year quest for justice.    Standing in front of the television cameras, Jennifer Schuett blinked back tears.    \"This is a huge day for me,\" she later told CNN over the phone. \"And I want to see this through the end. The rest will come out during the trial.\"    Schuett, 27, joined a multi-agency team of investigators in her hometown of Dickinson, Texas, as they announced the arrest earlier in the day of Dennis Earl Bradford, a 40-year-old welder, in Little Rock, Arkansas.    The arrest came after new DNA testing and other evidence made it possible to identify Bradford as the suspect.    Schuett's boyfriend and two police investigators who kept the case alive stood beside her. Fighting tears, she thanked them for their support.    \"Throughout this journey, I've had two main goals,\" she said. \"And they were to find the man who kidnapped, sexually assaulted and attempted to murder me 19 years ago so that he could not hurt anyone else. And to use my voice in telling my story to as many people as I possibly could over the years in hopes that I may encourage other victims of violent crimes to stand up and speak out against criminals.\"  Watch Schuett explain why she's speaking out \u00bb    She continued, \"Today, I can say very proudly that I have accomplished both of these goals.\"    Schuett spoke with CNN two weeks ago about her 1990 ordeal. CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults. But Schuett decided to go public with her story and her name to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker.    Schuett was in her bed when a man crept in through a window on August 10, 1990. She remembers waking up in a stranger's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot. She said he told her he was an undercover cop and knew her family.    He drove her through the streets of Dickinson, pulling into an overgrown field where, she said, he sexually assaulted her.    She passed out. When she regained consciousness, she was lying on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed and her voice box torn. She spent about 14 hours in the field before she was found and rushed to the hospital in critical condition.    \"Three days after the attack, I started giving a description. The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again, but I proved them all wrong,\" Schuett said. She believes she got her voice back so she could tell her story.    At the news conference, a driver's license photo of the suspect was shown next to the 1990 sketch based on her description. There was a clear resemblance.  Watch the sketch artist's memories of Schuett \u00bb    Shauna Dunlap, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Houston office, said Bradford lived in North Little Rock, with his wife and two children -- a boy, 12, and a girl, 15. He also has three adult stepchildren.    Bradford worked as a welder for United Fence in North Little Rock. A company representative said Bradford had been working there for 10 years and was a \"good guy\" who had mended \"his old ways\" and \"changed his life.\" He wouldn't go into specifics about what those \"old ways\" were. Court documents give some indication.    In 1996, Bradford was accused of kidnapping, sexually assaulting and cutting the throat of a female victim. He was initially charged with attempt to commit first-degree murder, but prosecutors amended the charges to rape and kidnapping.    A Garland County Circuit Court jury found him guilty of kidnapping but was not able reach a verdict on the rape charges. Arkansas corrections officials said he entered prison in March 1997, facing a 12-year-sentence, and was paroled in February 2000. Investigators also found Bradford lived slightly more than two miles from Schuett's residence and just a mile and a half from where she was found, according to an affidavit released Tuesday.    \"It's truly a rare occasion when we have the opportunity to prosecute a case like this,\" said Galveston County District Attorney Kurt Sistrunk. His office is charging Bradford with attempted capital murder.    \"Jennifer has been a tremendous asset to this investigation from the beginning, an inspiration to all of us, and we are going to be very proud to have Jennifer by our side as we continue with our efforts to seek justice for you in the courtroom,\" said Sistrunk.    The break in the case came after FBI agent Richard Rennison and Dickinson police Detective Tim Cromie persuaded the FBI's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) team to get involved.    \"The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive,\" Rennison said. \"In cases of child abduction, it is rare that the child is recovered alive. Frequently, you recover a body. And most times, you never find them.\"    In March 2008, the investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago -- the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing, as well as a man's underwear and T-shirt, which were found in the field where Schuett was left for dead.    The clothes had been tested in 1990, but the sample wasn't large enough for conclusive results. But newer techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell.    The FBI lab recently informed Rennison that the DNA in the man's underwear matched Bradford's DNA profile. He was entered into the database after the 1997 kidnapping conviction in Arkansas.    Bradford was arrested on Tuesday morning on his way to work. He awaits extradition to Texas.

Lebanese women wait in line to cast their votes in Beirut.    Voters in Beirut sent pro-government candidate Mohammed al-Amin Itani to parliament to replace Walid Eido, who was killed in a June bombing.    Both Eido, a Sunni Muslim, and Itani are members of the bloc led by Saad Hariri -- the son of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose 2005 killing triggered Lebanon's current wave of political upheaval.    But in Metn, a Maronite Christian suburb east of the capital, anti-government candidate Camille Khouri upset former President Amin Gemayel by a few hundred votes, Lebanese television network LBC reported.    Khouri is a member of the Free Patriotic Movement, the anti-government party led by former Lebanese Army Gen. Michel Aoun. Aoun has said he will run for president of Lebanon -- and since the post is chosen by members of parliament, Sunday's results were closely watched.    Gemayel was seeking the seat held by his son Pierre, who served as industry minister in the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora before being gunned down in his car in November 2006. He served as president from 1982 to 1988, during the civil war in Lebanon.    His brother, Bashir Gemayel, was elected president in 1982 but was assassinated before he could take office.    Eido and Gemayel were among several Lebanese political figures killed since the February 2005 killing of the elder Hariri. All were critical of Syria's influence in Lebanon, and their supporters blamed Damascus for their deaths -- allegations the Syrians and their allies in Lebanon denied.    Hariri's killing triggered a wave of protests against Syria known as the \"Cedar Revolution,\" which brought Siniora's government to power and forced Syria to withdraw the garrison it kept in Lebanon for three decades.

Florida Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Kirkwood last week granted a temporary injunction against release of the footage, which was captured on February 24 at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. It was not immediately clear for how long the injunction would last.      Trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, was interacting with an orca named Tilikum when it grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at Shamu Stadium. She died of multiple traumatic injuries and drowning, authorities said.      Jon Mills, the attorney for Brancheau's family, argued that their right to privacy outweighs other concerns.      \"The potential harm to this family is incredibly severe,\" Mills said. \"There is no constitutional right to voyeurism and there is a constitutional right to privacy, and the court is being asked to balance those.\"      Coverage from CNN affiliate WKMG      Court mediation will weigh privacy concerns against the public's right to know under Florida law.

Cherilyn Lee is a holisitic health practitioner and has been in  healthcare for 23 years, her Web site states.    Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse and nurse practitioner who first met Jackson in January to treat his children for a common cold, said she rejected his requests for Diprivan and informed him of the side effects.    \"I told him this medication is not safe,\" Lee said. \"He said, 'I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep.' \"    \"I told him -- and it is so painful that I actually felt it in my whole spirit -- 'If you take this you might not wake up.' \"    According to the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, nurse practitioners \"provide high-quality healthcare services similar to those of a doctor.\" They can also prescribe medications, according to the academy's Web site.    CNN could not independently verify whether Lee worked with Jackson.    When asked about Lee's account, Jackson family attorney Londell McMillan said:    \"I wonder why someone would make a comment about drugs when they haven't seen him take the drug or anyone who administered it.\"    The drug, known by its generic name Propofol, is administered intravenously as an anesthetic during surgeries.  Watch nurse describe Jackson's drug request \u00bb    An initial dose puts a person to sleep. An overdose can lead to cardiac arrest, doctors say.    Jackson died June 25 at the age of 50. Authorities are awaiting toxicology results to determine what killed him.    Lee is licensed as a registered nurse, according to the California Board of Registered Nursing Web site. According to her Web site, she is a proponent of alternative medicine that uses a holistic approach.    Lee said that four days before Jackson's death, she received a call from a Jackson staff member who said the singer felt that one side of his body was cold; the other hot.    \"I could hear Mr. Jackson saying in the background, 'Please have her come see me now. Can she come now?' \"    Lee, who was in Florida at the time, said she told Jackson's staffers to take him to a hospital.    \"I was really afraid because of the symptoms they were telling me,\" she said. \"It could have meant something going on in the nervous system or something cardiovascular.\"    After his death, Lee said she didn't go to the authorities.    \"When I saw it on the news, I really didn't know what to do,\" she said. \"I was saddened. I heard there was a physician there.\"    Lee also could not say why Jackson would call on her, when the last time she saw him was three months ago.    \"The only think I can think of is he recalled the symptoms I was telling him,\" she said.    But, she added, she didn't know of any doctors who would have given him the drug.    \"I asked him, 'What doctor gave you this drug?' \" she said, when the singer initially brought up the medicine. \"He told me, 'Oh it was a long time ago.' \"    Dr. Rakesh Marwah of the anesthesiology department at the Stanford University School of Medicine said Propofol can lead to cardiac arrest, which is suspected in Jackson's death.    \"Propofol slows down the heart rate and slows down the respiratory rate and slows down the vital functions of the body,\" he said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/bec5dbc570520c709e840e2e09572aefc6cd4fb3.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "who fired guns in celebration", "id": "107702", "answers": [{"text": "Hezbollah militia", "answer_start": 16}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "WHat did Palestinians do to celebrate the event?", "id": "108553", "answers": [{"text": "revelers spilled into the streets, honked car horns and fired guns", "answer_start": 3226}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- In the Hezbollah militia strongholds in southern Beirut and south Lebanon, they set off fireworks and fired guns in the air. In the northern Israeli city of Haifa, people waved Egyptian and Palestinian flags.      But when Egypt's vice president read President Hosni Mubarak's resignation statement Friday, patrons watching TV in Tavelino Cafe in Amman, Jordan, suddenly turned quiet.      The cafe's Egyptian manager \"clearly is not happy about the news,\" said CNN iReporter Johnny Colt. \"Just last night, the man spoke to me at length about Egypt and why Mubarak needed to stay until September. When I asked him how he felt about the Mubarak news, my new friend suddenly told me he cannot speak English and that I should use my computer to find English news.\"      Such was the disparity of opinions that could be heard in the Middle East about the events unfolding in Egypt on Friday. So, too, were the responses from world leaders and political organizations -- some of whom ascribed starkly different reasons for the historic significance of the moment.      To British Prime Minister David Cameron, Mubarak's departure was an important first step for a nation yearning for democracy.      \"Today has been a remarkable day,\" Cameron said, \"particularly for those people in Tahrir Square and elsewhere, who have spoken out so bravely and so peacefully for change in their country.\"      French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed Egypt's \"historic moment\" and paid tribute to Mubarak's decision to resign. He called for steps leading to free elections and reforms and urged Egyptians \"to continue their non-violent march to freedom.\"      For the government of Iran, Egypt's political earthquake meant something entirely different.      \"A new Middle East is taking shape, not the Mideast the West had planned for but one which has been created based on Islamic awakening,\" said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast in an interview with state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.      Iran's semi-official Fars news agency called it \"joyful coincidence\" that Egypt's revolution culminated on the 32nd anniversary of Iran's Islamic revolution victory.      Elsewhere in the region, political groups, some of which are hostile to Israel and the West, were quick to attach the success of the Egyptian revolt to their own aspirations.      Mohammed Al-Qubati, a spokesman for Yemen's biggest opposition coalition, the Joint Meeting Parties, said \"the map of the Arab nations will change as a result of the revolution.\"      \"Mubarak's fall,\" Al-Qubati said, \"proves that oppression and use of force cannot add life to the current regimes, and time for change has come.\"      The Joint Meeting Parties is primarily a coalition of Islamists and Socialists.      Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri called Mubarak's ouster \"a victory for the Palestinian people.\"      Hamas, said Zuhri, \"calls on the new Egyptian leadership to lift the siege of Gaza and to open the Rafah crossing and assure the free movement between Egypt and Palestine and to start the development construction process of Gaza.\"      Zuhri's remarks reflected the sentiments of Palestinians in Hamas-controlled Gaza and the West Bank. In Gaza, revelers spilled into the streets, honked car horns and fired guns in celebration.      Israel's two major TV channels carried the announcement of Mubarak's departure live, with images from Cairo's Tahrir Square supplemented by their political and Arab affairs commentators debating what the development means for Israel.      The headline on the website of Israel's largest newspaper, Yedioth Aronoth, read, \"Mubarak Quits -- Masses Elated.\"      The Israeli government said little about the fall of Mubarak.      The Anti-Defamation League in New York issued a statement expressing concern about how the political transformation of Egypt will affect Israel and \"what role the Muslim Brotherhood will play in the transition and beyond.\"      In Lebanon, public reaction appeared muted. Diners in small cafes watched Arab satellite coverage of the Egyptian street celebrations. For some, it brought back nostalgic memories of the 2005 uprising that kicked the Syrians out of Lebanon.      However, a Hezbollah spokesman told CNN, \"this is the true path when the people believe in their resolve\" and it makes all their sacrifices worthwhile.\"      The spokesman applauded the \"the steadfastness and unity of the Egyptian people, young and old, men and women, which showed that blood was stronger than the sword.\"      Mubarak frequently accused Hezbollah cells of infiltrating Egypt at the behest of Iran.      Western leaders have expressed concerns that a post-Mubarak Egypt could become another Iran. Egypt's pro-Western neighbors fear their governments could suffer similar fates if popular uprisings spread to their countries.      Few, if any, representatives of those governments publicly uttered such fears on Friday.      Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh called Egypt \"a pillar in the region\" and sent along \"wishes for stability, security and prosperity.\"      A statement from the United Arab Emirates said its government \"is always keen to foster brotherly, distinguished historic ties with Egypt in a way that serves the interests of the two brotherly countries and their peoples.\"      Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan released a statement expressing his government's \"hope for a peaceful transition to a participatory and pluralistic order in full respect for human rights.\"      Erdogan called on Egyptian military officials to exercise \"common sense and restraint\" in the transfer of power to a new democratically-elected government.      So did officials representing Western governments.      In the United States, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said \"it is crucial that Mubarak's departure be an orderly one and that it leads to true democracy for Egypt, including free, fair and open elections.\"      \"We caution all sides against violence during this transition, and we will be watching the situation closely,\" Reid said.      Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper called for an Egyptian government \"that will continue to respect peace treaties and seek peace in the Middle East.\"      Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among others, said their governments were ready to help Egypt make the transition to a democratic society.      Merkel said her country would \"support as much as we can the justified requests of the people in Egypt.\"      China's government won't be joining Germany.      Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said, \"China understands and supports Egypt's efforts to maintain social stability and restore normal order and that the affairs of Egypt should be decided by itself independently without intervention from the outside.\"      \"China cherishes the traditional friendship and strategic cooperation with Egypt, and believes that the friendly relations between the two countries will continue to develop in a sound and steady manner,\" the official said.

It was the ninth meeting of the president's war council to consider whether to send more troops to Afghanistan, as requested by the U.S. commander on the ground there.    The White House made no statement after the meeting ended at 10 p.m. ET (0300 GMT).    The meeting included Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen, Afghanistan commanding Gen. Stanley McChrystal, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry and other senior officials, the White House said earlier.    At the last war council meeting -- on November 11, Veteran's Day -- Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government.    Obama would seek answers to the questions he posed on November 11 about \"not just how we get people there, but what's the strategy for getting them out,\" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said before the meeting.    No matter what happened at the meeting, Gibbs said, Obama will not announce a decision on troop deployment until at least next week.    One option calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country, with other options involving variations of that plan, sources told CNN.    Before the November 11 meeting, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, told CNN that the decision-making process was approaching completion. Petraeus emphasized the need to focus on the mission of ensuring that Afghanistan \"does not once again become a sanctuary or safe haven for al Qaeda and the kind of transnational extremists that carried out the 9/11 attacks.\"    The Obama administration has expressed concerns about Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai's viability and has ratcheted up pressure to end corruption in order to combat an intensifying Taliban insurgency.    Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on a trip to Afghanistan last week to attend Karzai's inauguration after his recent re-election, reiterated the U.S. concerns in a dinner meeting with Karzai and encouraged him to seize the \"clear window of opportunity\" before him at a \"critical moment\" in Afghanistan's history.    The United States and other countries are increasing their civilian presence in Afghanistan to bolster efforts to stabilize the country, the the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, told reporters on Monday.    Asked about the corruption problem, Holbrooke noted that some Afghan government ministers have \"extraordinary records\" of accomplishment. The United States will work with those ministers, while recognizing that years of civil war and social woes have weakened overall leadership capabilities in Afghanistan, he said.    \"This is one of the main reasons we're increasing our civilian role,\" Holbrooke said. \"And it's extremely delicate to get the mix right. We want to help the Afghans help themselves. We do not want to replace a sovereign government with internationals.\"    Republican opponents are pushing Obama to quickly agree to McChrystal's reported request for up to 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan as part of a counterinsurgency strategy.    \"This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future,\" said a letter to Obama from 10 Republican senators sent on Veteran's Day."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4f0babcd4dd2ab0fd1f177dfe680cdc1a2d81865.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did state officials say about Santa Barbara County?", "id": "107710", "answers": [{"text": "said Thursday that they have not yet been approached, and it was not clear whether the family had decided to pursue that option.", "answer_start": 363}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The family of Michael Jackson has been told by state officials that it may be possible to bury the singer at Neverland Ranch -- if the county gives the green light.    Santa Barbara County says it hasn't yet been contacted about burying Michael Jackson at Neverland.    Officials with Santa Barbara County, the site of the ranch, said Thursday that they have not yet been approached, and it was not clear whether the family had decided to pursue that option.    A lawyer from the Jackson family contacted state officials recently about possibly burying Jackson at the ranch that was his home for almost two decades, said Amanda Fulkerson of California's State and Consumer Services Agency.    To bury someone on private land in California is a two-step process.    First, a certificate of authority is needed from the state Cemetery and Funeral Bureau -- easily obtainable by filling out a two-page application and paying $400. Next, the family needs approval from the county.    No one from the Jackson camp has contacted county authorities yet, said county spokesman William Boyer.    \"We have had no formal application either from the Jackson family or from the property owner,\" said Boyer, the communications director for the county. \"At that point, we would review the application and make a determination.\"    Boyer said Santa Barbara county has never been approached about burial on private land.    California has had burials outside cemeteries, most notably that of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan at his presidential library in Ventura County's Simi Valley.    Jackson's brother Jermaine said he'd like to see the singer buried at the ranch. But their father, Joe Jackson, said he opposes the site.    The rest of the family has expressed no preference about Jackson's final resting place. Michael Jackson died June 25 of a cardiac arrest. The exact cause of death is pending toxicology results.    Jackson purchased the Neverland Ranch -- named for the fictional world in J.M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan\" -- in 1987 and filled it with animals and amusement rides.

In the incident, which happened Thursday, the 5-year-old animal killed the circus administrator, Dmitry Potapov, and mauled an animal trainer, who was attempting to rescue him.    \"The incident occurred during a rehearsal by the Russian state circus company troupe which was performing in Bishkek with the program, Bears on Ice,\" Ministry of Culture and Information director Kurmangazy Isanayev told reporters.

Medical personnel were unable to save Potapov, who died at the scene.    The 29-year-old circus trainer Yevgeny Popov, who attempted to rescue Potapov, was also severely injured, according to doctors.    \"The victim has sustained serious injuries - deep scalp lacerations, bruising of the brain, lacerations on his body. His condition is considered critical,\" Dr. Gulnara Tashibekova told reporters on Russian state television.    After the incident, the circus was cordoned off by police and emergency service workers. Experts have been brought in to examine the bear, which was shot and died at the scene.

One of the protesters hit by the spray told CNN's Lemon that she was still feeling some after-effects Saturday evening.      \"I was shocked,\" said Sophia Kamran. \"When students are sitting on the ground and (have) no way of moving to be violent, being totally peaceful, I don't understand the use of pepper spray against them.\"      On Saturday evening, as Katehi left campus, dozens of students sat cross-legged and with their arms linked in a silent protest. A reporter asked Katehi, \"Do you still feel threated by the students?\"      \"No,\" she said. \"No.\"      Photos: Navigating a mob on a 'day of action'      DES MOINES, IOWA      The crowd at the Family Leader Thanksgiving forum in Des Moines erupted in applause as GOP president contender Newt Gingrich said the Occupy protesters need to \"Go get a job, right after you take a bath.\"      \"All the Occupy movement starts with the premise that we all owe them everything,\" he said. \"They take over a public park they didn't pay for, to go nearby to use bathrooms they didn't pay for, to beg for food from places they don't want to pay for, to obstruct those who are going to work to pay the taxes to sustain the bathrooms and to sustain the park, so they can self-righteously explain they are the paragons of virtue to which we owe everything.      \"Now, that is a pretty good symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country, and why you need to reassert something by saying to them, 'Go get a job right after you take a bath.'\"      OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA      Oakland police on Sunday cleared an encampment set up by Occupy protesters a day earlier in a vacant city lot. The removal took place without incident. No arrests nor injuries were reported, according to a city news release.      \"Oakland, not unlike many cities across the country, supports upholding free speech and peaceful forms of expression, but the cost of the encampments is growing and putting a strain on our already fragile resources -- police, public works, and other City staff,\" Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said in a statement.      The encampment was set up Saturday night when protesters tore down a chain link fence surrounding the lot and put up tents as police watched, but did not intervene.      The lot is in a district of shops and nightclubs, and the new Occupy venue did not sit well with some residents.      \"I don't want it in my front yard, my backyard nor my side yard,\" resident Toni Vasquez told CNN affiliate KGO. \"This is not the way to do it.

Dr. Jennifer Madden, a family physician, began her transition to being female at age 48.    \"I really wanted to be a girl so bad, and that was one way for me to satisfy those feelings,\" Madden said. \"I always felt like someone was looking over my shoulder.\"    The desire to be female never went away. At age 48, Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor, and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered.    Through reconstructive surgeries, electrolysis, laser procedures and voice lessons, Henry Joseph became Jennifer Elizabeth, known as Jenny. She is a practicing family physician in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Watch Jenny's story \u00bb    Chastity Bono, child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male.    While still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. The term \"LGBT\" (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) is more commonly recognized, and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film \"Boys Don't Cry\" as well as the 2002 book \"Middlesex\" by Jeffrey Eugenides.    Many people who have transitioned, including Madden, say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood. As early as age 3, Dr. Julie Praus, born male, didn't understand why her father wanted to play catch. As a boy, Praus learned how to fish and hunt, but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases. Praus, 48, a psychiatrist in Brattleboro, Vermont, started living as a woman in March 2008.    \"I get up every morning and say, 'Wow, I can actually look at myself in the mirror,' because I've never been able to do that in my life, because what would stare back at me was not me,\" Praus said. iReport.com: Share your story of gender change    Doctors speculate that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined what in the biological makeup determines that gender. The interactions between personality and culture also contribute to identity, said Chris Kraft, clinical director at the Johns Hopkins Sexual Behaviors Consultation Unit.    The process of changing genders    For people who want a gender change on a biological level, the first step is therapy, experts say. Dr. Gary Alter, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California, said patients don't come to him until they've been in therapy, a process that can take as much as a year.    A therapist then gives a physician approval to start the patient on hormone treatment. At that point, the patient may or may not start living as the chosen sex, Alter said.    Females seeking to transition into males may elect to have their breasts removed via surgery. With testosterone, they will grow hair on their face and chest after about two years. Read one man's female-to-male advice to Chaz Bono    A higher percentage of males transitioning to females will go forward with genital surgery than females going to males, Alter said. Surgical methods for creating a penis -- which range from making one out of the clitoris to using the skin from the forearms -- are \"not perfect,\" and many patients are happy with just chest surgery, he said.    Genital surgeries for creating female genitalia are better, he said. Alter's method is to make a clitoris out of the head of the penis, and make space for a vagina.    Facing the rest of the world    It is rare for people to undergo a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved, experts say.    Some say changing genders is one of the best things they've done, like Jamison Green, 60, author of \"Becoming a Visible Man,\" who went through chest reconstruction and genital surgery.    \"I don't have too hard of a time telling people about it,\" Green said. \"I worried about that a lot in the beginning, before there was any kind of community and support about this condition, but one of the things I learned early on was that living in fear and shame is not very healthy.\"    Green, who started his transition at age 40, is now happily married to a woman whom he did not know before his change. Praus is also married to a woman, who knew her before her transition. Madden has a boyfriend.    \"For the longest time, I really felt like I had a mental illness, and I don't feel that way anymore,\" Madden said.    But all three have experienced shock and dismay from others around them. Green said his mother took five years to adjust. One of Praus' sons doesn't speak to her. Madden's marriage to a woman ended in divorce during her transition, and her children have struggled.    Yet these three transgendered individuals say they feel better in many ways in their chosen gender roles.    \"My patients say I'm a better doctor,\" Praus said. \"Some of it is that I'm not exerting so much energy hiding myself.\"    Psychologists recommend that people who change genders adopt a \"transgendered identity,\" and not keep their history of transition a secret. But some who \"pass\" as their new genders don't want to risk stigma, and tell only people closest to them, Kraft said.    Often, males who transition to females face more problems than females who become males, Kraft said. Transgendered individuals who start as men tend to face more stigma, particularly if they are more noticeably transgendered.    Transgendered individuals do face some legal quandaries. Some states require people to show proof of a medical procedure before changing gender on documents such as driver's licenses, while others require that the person has taken hormones, Kraft said. People may also elect to change their birth certificates to reflect chosen gender.    Chastity Bono, who now goes by \"Chaz,\" has been a prominent gay-rights activist.    \"You could speculate that that could make it more complicated -- when you're a public figure -- to take on something stigmatizing\" such as a gender transition, Kraft said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9bca7481982223a4ac82c28d19557f83a6b05399.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What type of program will receive $84,500?", "id": "107718", "answers": [{"text": "nonprofit", "answer_start": 1079}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- More than 2,000 students in Southern California laid 65 miles of pennies on a speedway track Thursday in an attempt to set a world record and help schools in the area.

THINK (Teaching, Helping, Inspiring & Nurturing Kids) Together didn't meet its original goal of laying out 100 miles of pennies at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California, but group spokeswoman Nadia Flores said the group is happy with the results.    \"We raised twice what we were able to lay down,\" she said. \"I think the energy and the vibe from having so many kids and volunteers present made it really fun.\"    Flores said the group ran out of time in its attempt to get all 100 miles laid out, but she added that they're confident they have the record anyway.    Guinness World Records, which would certify the record, said Thursday it had not yet received documentation from the group. The current record for pennies laid out is 40 miles.    The money -- about $84,500 -- will go to the nonprofit program that provides free after-school care for students at more than 200 elementary and middle schools in at-risk communities in four California counties -- Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino.    Flores said the idea for \"Miles of Change\" came after group members saw students at a school in Kansas make a 40-mile chain of pennies in July 2008 to set the world record.    Flores said her group, based in Santa Ana, California, wanted a program that would unite the counties involved -- and set a record.    The pennies were collected by 35,000 students in the after-school program and were laid in loops around the two-mile track in Fontana, California.    Flores said every penny must be touching the next penny in order to qualify for the Guinness world record. Documentation will include aerial photos, she said.    Each student took home tubes to collect the pennies. Students who collected the most got tickets to future Los Angeles Dodgers games, Flores said.    The effort also is meant to honor Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday and the 100th anniversary of the introduction of the Lincoln penny."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f1e8ec9c8b4791d2a58ad0fbf0524118c102a8ea.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Whos long term aides were replaced?", "id": "107719", "answers": [{"text": "Fidel Castro", "answer_start": 2600}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- In a major shake-up the likes of which Cubans have not seen for decades, President Raul Castro on Monday reorganized his Cabinet, replacing longtime aides to his brother Fidel, who resigned from office a year ago, citing poor health.    Cuban President Raul Castro is moving his own people into power, analysts say.    Some analysts said the changes appear to be an attempt by Raul Castro to put his own supporters into positions of power.    Among the changes:    Felipe Perez Roque, the 43-year-old foreign minister, was replaced by his deputy, Bruno Rodriguez Aprilla.    Carlos Lage Davila, an economist, lost his job as Cabinet secretary, but no mention was made of removing him from his other post as vice president of the Council of State.    Lage, who helped guide the nation through its \"special period\" of dire economic times in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the loss of billions in subsidies, was replaced by Brig. Gen. Jose Amado Ricardo Guerra; Raul Castro is also commander in chief of the armed forces.    \"It looks like Raul putting some of his own people in,\" said Wayne Smith, director of the Cuba program at the Center for International Policy in Washington, who led the U.S. Interests Section in Havana during the Carter administration.    Smith noted that Cuba's government underwent \"quite a few shake-ups after the revolution first came in\" in 1959, but said Monday's move \"is the biggest shake-up that I've seen in a very long time ... for the last 30 or 40 years.\"    \"This is obviously a major move,\" concurred Vicki Huddleston, who led the Interests Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and is a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"[There is] nothing like this that I can recall since the late 1960s.\"    She noted that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez met with both Castro brothers during a visit late in February to Havana, on what Granma described as a \"work visit,\"  and speculated that Raul Castro may have asked him then to buy in on the changes.    \"They really need Chavez to be on board, because without the subsidized oil from Venezuela, they're dead,\" Huddleston said.    With the Cuban economy hamstrung by the world economy, Raul Castro may have decided it is time for him to make reforms of his own without worrying about second-guessing by his brother or his brother's allies, she said.    Huddleston speculated that the changes could portend the government once again allowing private enterprise to flourish in Cuba.    Communist leader Fidel Castro experimented with that during the 1990s, but pulled back.    \"It represents a significant step by Raul Castro to gain autonomy and, essentially, distance himself from Fidel's old gang,\" said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs.    \"In other words, he feels confident enough that he has an independent base of power.\"    He said Raul Castro's moves to date have proven popular not only with his party members, but also with the general population. Still, Raul Castro should not take that support for granted, Birns said. \"It may be that, if he makes too many moves, the party will feel that their privileges are being taken away, and that will make them unhappy.\"    Otto Reich, who served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs during the George W. Bush administration, said he was withholding judgment.    \"It's a little early to tell what this really means,\" he said. \"Some people are saying the Fidelistas are being replaced by the Raulistas. But the other side is: Are we talking about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic?\"    The state-run newspaper Granma published an official notice from the State Council that said the changes were intended to form a structure that is \"more compact and functional, with fewer organisms of the central administration of the state and a better distribution of the functions that they carry out.\"    CNN's Morgan Neill and Shasta Darlington in Havana, Tom Watkins and Arthur Brice contributed to this story."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/51a11d5fdf18a8a648bd353ea22a1cb23b689a0f.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What type of photo does she admit to?", "id": "107720", "answers": [{"text": "lingerie modeling", "answer_start": 105}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Are there any more photos?", "id": "108823", "answers": [{"text": "several", "answer_start": 396}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Miss California USA Carrie Prejean has assured pageant officials that a lingerie modeling photo published online this week is the only one she posed for, the state pageant director said.      Miss California USA Carrie Prejean may lose her crown because of some semi-nude photos she appeared in.      But the Web site that published the first picture said it has several more that it will \"slowly roll out\" starting Wednesday afternoon.      The possibility that racier images could emerge prompted \"closed-door meetings\" Tuesday to consider stripping Prejean of her beauty queen title, pageant spokesman Ron Neal said.      Although Neal said Prejean \"breached her contract\" by keeping the semi-nude photo or photos a secret, the only picture published so far appears about as revealing as the bikini Prejean wore in the pageant's swimsuit competition.      \"We have been told by Carrie Prejean there are no other photos other than the one circulating in existence. She should know better than anyone,\" Miss California USA Director Keith Lewis said Wednesday.      The 21-year-old Miss USA contestant has been the center of controversy since she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in a response to a question on the national pageant stage last month. She finished as runner-up to Miss USA.      In a statement given to CNN Tuesday, Prejean said the photos -- and she did use the plural -- were being used in a \"vicious and mean-spirited\" effort to silence her for \"defending traditional marriage.\"      While she vowed to \"continue to support and defend marriage as the honorable institution it is,\" Prejean may be doing so without the Miss California USA title.      State pageant officials met Tuesday with lawyers and representatives of Donald Trump, who owns the international competition, to consider if they had grounds to take the crown away from Prejean, according to Neal.      \"When you compete for Miss California, you're supposed to disclose whether you posed for nude or semi-nude photos because it's grounds for disqualification,\" he said.      CNN obtained a copy of the pageant contract Prejean signed last year in which she agreed that the discovery of semi-nude photos could mean disqualification.      The only photo made public shows Prejean -- who said she was 17 at the time -- wearing pink panties and no top. She is turned away from the camera, with her arm hiding most of her breast.      It was unclear if pageant officials would consider this a semi-nude photo, in light of their standard requirement that contestants parade across stage wearing a bikini that arguably shows more bare skin.      But the other shoe -- or other garment -- may be yet to drop.      Nik Richie -- of TheDirty.com -- said he has waited for an upgrade of his Web site's servers to handle the flood of traffic he expects will come after he posts the additional photos.      \"I will slowly roll these out,\" Richie said.      The next image will likely be published Wednesday afternoon, he said.      \"We'll see what happens with those and we want to know who's releasing them,\" Neal said.      Shanna Moakler, the co-executive director of the Miss California USA organization, will meet with Tami Farrell, the runner-up for the title, \"to discuss the possible next steps,\" Neal said.      Prejean defended the photos, which she said were taken when she was a teenager aspiring to be a Victoria's Secret model.      \"I am a Christian, and I am a model,\" she said. \"Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos.\"      She said the photos \"have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith.\"      \"I am not perfect, and I will never claim to be,\" she said. \"But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive. While we may not agree on every issue, we should show respect for others' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean-spirited attacks.\"      Her publicist, Melany Ethridge, confirmed a comment she gave to celebrity Web site TMZ in which she said Prejean was just 17 when she posed for the photos, hoping they would land her a modeling job.      \"In her naivete, an agent convinced her to pose for this photo to submit to a lingerie company, claiming they could make her the next Victoria's Secret model,\" Ethridge told TMZ. \"She has since learned what a lie that was, and what a mistake it was to have the photo taken.\"      Prejean announced last week that she would star in a new $1.5 million ad campaign supporting what she termed \"opposite marriage\" (marriage between a man and a woman) funded by the National Organization for Marriage.      \"Marriage is good,\" Prejean said at a news conference announcing the ad campaign. \"There is something special about unions of husband and wife.

Bin Laden has publicly called on his father to abandon terrorism.  He prepared his formal asylum request Tuesday at the airport with the help of a translator, filing it around 1 p.m., the spokeswoman said.  The Interior Ministry, which had 72 hours to reply to the request, was required to seek the opinion of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on the matter.

It was not immediately known what grounds bin Laden gave for his request, and the spokeswoman said it is unlikely to be disclosed.

U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean was arrested in Mexico in April.  U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, 21, who was arrested in Mexico in April, could be returned to Onslow County, North Carolina, within a week, the county sheriff's office said in a statement issued Thursday. Federal authorities will handle his transportation to the North Carolina jail.  Laurean has been indicted on first-degree murder and other charges in the death of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach. Her charred body and that of her fetus were found beneath a fire pit in Laurean's backyard near Camp Lejeune, where both were stationed, in January, a month after she was last seen.  Prosecutors allege that Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico to avoid prosecution.  Laurean was arrested in April in San Juan Vina, in the Mexican state of Michoacan. Because he holds citizenship in the United States and Mexico, he could not be immediately deported and had to go through the extradition process, authorities said.  Asked by a Mexican reporter at the time of his arrest whether he killed Lauterbach, Laurean said, \"I loved her.\"  As part of the effort to apprehend Laurean, authorities seized a computer belonging to his sister-in-law that Laurean's wife, Christina, was using to communicate with him, a law enforcement official had said.  If convicted, Onslow County prosecutors said, Laurean would face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Mexico's extradition policy prohibits U.S. authorities from seeking the death penalty against fugitives it hands over.  Authorities found Lauterbach's body after Christina Laurean produced a note her husband had written claiming that the 20-year-old woman slit her own throat during an argument, according to officials.  Although a gaping 4-inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach's neck, autopsy results indicate that the wound itself would not have been fatal.  Prosecutors have said there was no evidence that Christina Laurean was involved in or aware of Lauterbach's slaying before she gave the note to authorities.  Lauterbach had accused Laurean of raping her, and it is unclear whether he was the father of her fetus, although her relatives have said they believe him to be. He had denied the rape allegation and said he had had no sexual contact with her.  Mary Lauterbach, the young woman's mother, has said she's unconvinced that the Marine Corps took her daughter's rape allegation and other allegations of \"harassment\" seriously. Her daughter's car was keyed, she said, and she was assaulted.  \"Those particular actions should have been taken much more seriously because the Marines were aware of them,\" she said Friday.

The Philippine Inquirer quoted the Lamitan city mayor, Roderick Furigay, as saying Kevin walked for two days, surviving on candies his captors presumably gave him and on coconuts that he retrieved by climbing trees.      \"In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations,\" Harry Thomas, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said in a weekend statement.      \"If ever we are to be inspired by the human spirit, we should take comfort in the courage, commitment and love that the Lunsmann family exhibited during this trying ordeal,\" Thomas added.      Fourteen gunmen snatched Kevin, his mother, Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, and his 19-year-old cousin, Romnick Jakaria, in July while they vacationed on the island of Tictabon, authorities said. The abductors forced them to board awaiting boats, which then sped off in the direction of Basilan.      Kevin's mother was released by her captors in October. Jakaria was released last month, according to the news agency.      Basilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines' minority Muslim population. The U.S. State Department considers the group a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda. The Philippines government has been fighting to contain the militants.      Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as past kidnappings.      Basilan's governor called on authorities Sunday to prosecute the alleged kidnappers of the Lunsmann family, according to the news agency.      \"The prosecution of kidnappers by a court of law will put a stop to kidnappings,\" the news agency quoted Jum Akbar as saying.      Thomas, the U.S. ambassador, said the crime will not go \"unpunished.\"      Gerfa Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia. She eventually married a German citizen. Both she and the son, Kevin, are U.S. passport holders.      Kevin's father told WSET that the boy will eventually share his story of escape, but did not say when.      \"I can tell you a lot of things, but I only know that he is a hero,\" he said.

He'll be writing about his preparations and giving his views on athletics leading up to the Games.    CNN -- May 20, 2008    Athletes and non-athletes alike often have the dream of going to the Olympic Games -- it's the ultimate experience in sports.    He may have not finished the London Marathon, but Gilbert Tuhabonye has overcome greater setbacks.    I am no exception and this year, I decided to go for it, but first I needed a qualifying time in the marathon. I decided that the Flora London Marathon was my best shot at getting a qualifying time that might land me a spot on the team of my country -- Burundi.    I trained hard in the U.S. and was feeling very good about the upcoming race.    A few weeks before I was heading out to London, I started to experience pain in my sciatic nerve, which started to pull at my hamstring. I continued to train and hope for the best, knowing that I have pushed my body many times before and worked through injury.    When I arrived in London and tried to run, my hamstring really gave me a lot of pain, but I did not panic. I thought it was from sitting on the plane over to London from Texas for ten hours. I continued to train and to stay hydrated and hope for the best.    The marathon is a race that must always be respected. You have to have a strategy and a back up plan. So, on the day of the race, I really felt good and tried to warm up. My hamstring was not cooperating. When I hit mile two, I knew that it was going to be rough and dialed back my time per mile time from 5:15 to 5:42 thinking I could make up the time later.    By mile 3, the pain was so terrible, I knew that the Olympics were out of the question. At mile 4 and 5 I thought that I would just finish the race, I could not quit.    Things began to get worse for me from that point. The rain had started and I was looking for the medical tent. There, they wrapped me up and told me to wait, but I just couldn't. I headed back to the course and started to walk.    The rain was really coming down at that point and I became upset. My dream was washing away through my tears onto the streets of London. I had never been in this part of a marathon before, but I knew a friend who was running and I tried to find her to help her and encourage her along the way.    Finally, a taxi driver saw me and double-backed, picked me up and dropped me off at my hotel. It was time to regroup and figure this out.    This was not the worse thing that has ever happened to me. I have survived worse situations.  Watch Gilbert Tuhabonye talk about his experiences \u00bb.    I started to reflect upon the fact that every time I try and train hard for a marathon, something happens. Perhaps this is just not the right time for me.    Perhaps God has something else in mind for me. I am being stubborn and pushing for something that is not supposed to be right now.    Now, I am home in Austin, Texas some weeks later.  Watch Gilbert coaching his Gilbert's Gazelles \u00bb.    Thankfully, my hamstring was not torn. I have done physical therapy and massage therapy to repair the damage.    I have been working hard at strengthening my core to support the rest of my body. I know that I still have that marathon in me, but it was not meant to be for this year.    There are so many issues with these Olympics -- the humidity, the pollution and now, the terrible crisis and suffering of the Chinese people hit by the earthquake. They are the ones who need our help, our hope and our prayers."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/bf3dd673d72edf70f431bb3a638a3cc124a3c3ae.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does COPA violate?", "id": "107735", "answers": [{"text": "the First Amendment.\"", "answer_start": 1589}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has blocked further consideration of a federal law designed to keep sexual material from underage users of the Web.  The justices without comment Wednesday rejected an appeal from the federal government to reinstate the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), passed by Congress in 1998. The high court and subsequent federal courts said the law -- which has never taken effect -- had serious free speech problems.  The Bush administration was a strong supporter of the law and the Justice Department led the fight in court to revive it.  The justices issued their ruling a day after all nine were on hand for the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor also attended the ceremony.  The case tested the free speech rights of adults against the power of Congress to control Internet commerce. The Supreme Court twice ruled against COPA, arguing that it represented government censorship rather than lawful regulation of adult-themed pornography businesses. The law would have prevented private businesses from creating and distributing \"harmful\" content that minors could access on the Internet.  Free speech advocates said adults would be barred access to otherwise legal material and that parental-control devices and various filtering technology are less intrusive ways to protect children.  The high court in 2004 upheld a preliminary injunction against the law and sent the case back to lower courts for consideration of the arguments. In their opinion at the time, the 5-4 majority concluded COPA \"likely violates the First Amendment.\"  \"The government has not shown that the less restrictive alternatives proposed ... should be disregarded,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the 2004 decision. \"Those alternatives, indeed, may be more effective\" than the law passed by Congress. \"Filters are less restrictive\" he said, and thus pose less risk of muzzling free speech. \"They impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not universal restrictions at the source.\"  He added, \"There is a potential for extraordinary harm and a serious chill upon protected speech\" if the law takes effect.\"  In reconsidering the law, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, again ruled the law unconstitutional."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9d3c4fe9982621dfb6d3884f27d3372d0763e5a7.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does the U.S. Fed do?", "id": "107736", "answers": [{"text": "providing special emergency financing for up to $30 billion in Bear Stearns assets.", "answer_start": 996}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. said Sunday that it is buying troubled Wall Street firm Bear Stearns, amid deepening fears that Bear's demise could have sent shockwaves across already shaky financial markets.    The deal to buy Bear Stearns is worth an estimated $236 million.    The deal values Bear Stearns at $236 million, or just $2 a share. Shares had closed at $30 on Friday, down 47 percent that day.    \"Effective immediately, JPMorgan Chase is guaranteeing the trading obligations of Bear Stearns and its subsidiaries and is providing management oversight for its operations,\" said a statement released Sunday by JPMorgan.    Shareholders must approve the deal, which is expected to close by the end of June.    JPMorgan is taking immediate responsibility for Bear's trading obligations and assuming \"management oversight\" of the firm's operations. The deal has already been approved by the Federal Reserve and other regulators, according to the statement.    The Fed is providing special emergency financing for up to $30 billion in Bear Stearns assets.    \"JPMorgan stands behind Bear Stearns,\" said Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan. \"Bear Stearns clients and counterparties should feel secure that JPMorgan is guaranteeing ... risk,\" he continued.    The fast-track deal is expected to close by the end of June, the statement said.    Bear Stearns was on the brink of financial collapse Friday when JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said they would provide the brokerage a short-term loan.    Bear was dealing with a classic \"run on the bank.\" The firm's short-term creditors refused to lend the firm any more money and simultaneously demanded repayment of outstanding debt.    The one-two punch overwhelmed Bear's cash position.

Watch a discussion on the impact on global markets \u00bb    Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Sunday that talks about how to rescue Bear had continued throughout the weekend.

The deal marks an inglorious chapter for 85-year-old Bear Stearns, a storied Wall Street firm the unraveling of which has been fast and furious.    Rumors that Bear Stearns was on the verge of collapse started buzzing around Wall Street trading desks last Monday. Chief Executive Alan Schwartz -- who took over as CEO in early January from longtime chief Jimmy Cayne -- appeared on television on Wednesday afternoon to reassure the markets that the firm was stable.    But by Thursday night, Bear was in a severe crunch. Some firms that trade with it effectively stopped offering it credit because they feared that Bear was running short of short-term funding, or liquidity.    \"The past week has been an incredibly difficult time for Bear Stearns,\" said Alan Schwartz, president and CEO of Bear Stearns. \"This transaction represents the best outcome for all of our constituencies based upon the current circumstances.\"    White House spokesman Tony Fratto told CNN on Sunday that Paulson has briefed U.S. President George W.

In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- and went on a 100-day killing rampage.    In June of 1994, Rwanda was still in the grip of a 100-day killing rampage.    Civilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors.    It was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million, 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents.    What started the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry    The Tutsi ethnic minority and the Hutu majority had been at odds even before 1994. The rivalry started during colonial times, when the Belgians considered Tutsis the privileged ethnicity, thus giving them better opportunities.    The Hutus were considered inferior, prompting resentment that was passed on through the generations. The first major assault on Tutsis occurred in 1959, killing thousands and prompting more attacks over the years.    The animosity caused the Tutsis to flee to neighboring countries, including Burundi and Uganda. The Hutus took over the government when Rwanda gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, but the resentment remained.    Hours before the genocide    In early April, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The president, his Burundian counterpart and their aides were killed. A few hours later, Rwanda erupted into chaos.    Some have accused current President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi, of masterminding the killing. Kagame, who led a Tutsi militia group at the time, has denied any ties. He has accused Hutu rebels of instigating the assassinations to incite fury and attacks on Tutsis.    Differences between Hutus and Tutsis    They speak the same language and practice the same customs. However, most Tutsis are considered tall and lanky, which has led to speculation that they have Ethiopian heritage. During the genocide, the bodies of Tutsis were thrown into rivers by the Hutus, who said they were sending them back to Ethiopia.    The aftermath of the genocide    After 100 days of death and destruction, the Tutsi militia led by Kagame defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the government. Scores of Hutus fled to neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where they have been accused of inciting more violence. Rwanda has invaded Congo various times to launch an offensive against Hutus allegedly linked to the genocide.    After the cease-fire, a multiethnic government made up of Hutu President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Kagame came into power. Bizimungu was later accused of ethnic discord and jailed. Kagame became president in 2000.    Trials for genocide suspects    Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide are tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried in gacaca courts.    The latter are community courts conducted by a panel of nine civilians in an open field.    The courts allow survivors to point out and confront their attackers. Gacaca means \"open grass\" in the local language. Human rights organizations say the gacacas fall short on delivering justice.    State of the nation 15 years later    Rwanda is now considered one of Africa's most stable nations. Education, health care, tourism and trade -- which were destroyed in the genocide -- have improved dramatically. Kagame has made big strides against corruption, a major problem in Africa.    However, critics have accused him of being an autocratic leader who has stifled the country's media. Others have said the growth in economy is limited to urban areas and has not trickled into rural areas."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/8c42f541a0eff6d8f29e00797d1c8a3fe20164bd.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did the shortage of paper and leather lead to?", "id": "107740", "answers": [{"text": "an increase in wartime piety, there was an actual Bible", "answer_start": 4638}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(MENTAL FLOSS) -- In the last 2,000 years, commodity shortages, financial speculation, wars, famines, and outright manias have created some pretty strange economic behavior throughout the world.  Once worthless Roman coins found in the British town of Snodland are considered quite a treasure.  Cake or death?  In order to stop rising inflation and devaluation of the currency in third century Rome, Emperor Diocletian instituted fixed prices on most consumer goods. Anyone selling goods at prices higher than those of the emperor was put to death; this led to hoarding of goods.  A law was then passed that forbade the hoarding of goods. Penalty? Death. So people just closed their businesses, then another law was passed. You guessed it: shut down your business or fail to follow in your father's business? Death. It's amazing the Roman Empire lasted as long as it did. Mental Floss: Strange things we didn't know were illegal  Gonna barter like it's B.C. 99  When the Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century, so did the Roman financial system. Part of the collapse was the disappearance of Roman coinage. Nowhere was this more evident than in England, where, according to archeological evidence, money basically disappeared, driving the British isles straight back to a barter economy.  Coinage only came back centuries later when the English were forced to pay protection money (Danegeld) to the Vikings to stop the constant pillaging.  99.9 percent pure  In 15th century Germany, grain shortages -- acceptable -- frequently led to beer shortages -- unacceptable. In response, brewers in towns like Munich and Regensburg used seeds, spices, and rushes to flavor their beers.  Showing an uncomfortable foreshadowing of future events, German authorities instituted purity laws stating that only water, barley, and hops could be used in the brewing of beer. The rule, or Reinheitsgebot, is still on the books today.  Nothing but the best for France  While the Sun King, Louis XIV, and his building of Versailles typically get all the credit for bankrupting France in the seventeenth century, his Minister of Finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert deserves some kudos as well. Colbert's tax schemes, deficit spending, and manic obsession with the production of luxury goods -- to the detriment, or outright exclusion of ordinary consumer goods -- emptied the French treasuries, drove the peasantry to starvation, and laid the foundation for the bloodiest revolution of the age.  But, let's face it: who wouldn't trade the fate of an entire nation for a really, really well made tapestry?  Adjustable rate mortgage, Archduke Ferdinand?  In the 1860s, the rulers of the newly-formed Austro-Hungarian Empire encouraged their bankers to be more free with their lending standards. Their goal was to encourage growth in the empire.  The result (this is going to sound eerily familiar) was over-speculation in building, massive default on borrowed funds, and economic collapse throughout Central Europe. The worldwide depression reached all the way to the United States and triggered the Panic of 1873.  On the bright side, many of the most beautiful buildings in Europe come from this period of \"irrational exuberance.\"  Mississippi burning  John Law, a Scottish banker and businessman, took control of a French enterprise called the Mississippi Company in 1717. In just a few years, he turned the company into the main economic force behind the French colonies throughout the world. The share price for the company went from about 500 livres in 1719 to 10,000 livres in 1720.  Just one year later though, in a rather Enron-like turnaround, the stock price collapsed, Law fled France, and the French government (as the primary shareholder) was forced to cancel a significant portion of its debt obligations leaving lenders throughout the world ruined. Economists refer to the episode as the \"Mississippi Bubble.\"  The Mason-Dixon bottom line  Many have read about the effects of hyperinflation on the German Weimar Republic. From 1920-1923, prices in Germany increased as much as 3.25 million percent. People burned their old currency for warmth, since it was less costly than buying wood.  But, few know that the same type of hyperinflation, albeit to a lesser extent, affected the Confederate States of America. From 1861 to 1864, the commodity price index rose as high as 10 percent a month. By the end of the Civil War, the cost of living in dear old Dixie was 92 percent higher than before the war. Mental Floss: The Confederacy's plan to conquer Latin America  Prayer pays  In 1943, due to shortage of raw materials like paper and leather, and an increase in wartime piety, there was an actual Bible shortage in the United States.  Tokyo falling  Japan had one of the most meteoric economic rises of the twentieth century. By the late '80s, property values had risen so high that all the land in Japan was worth four times the value of all the property in the United States. The real estate value of Tokyo alone was valued at more than that of all America.

But before real-time Web becomes a reality, developers say they need to figure out how to protect people's privacy while blasting out as much information as they can, as fast as they can.    \"A lot of this data that people would like to make available, they wouldn't necessarily want to make available to everyone,\" said Jack Moffitt, chief technical officer for Collecta, a search engine that aims to give real-time results. \"I think we'll be wrestling with privacy issues around real-time data for a long time.\"    The idea behind a real-time Web is to create technology that doesn't require an Internet user to actively seek out something they're interested in. That could mean anything from getting pinged when an article about your favorite sports team is posted to an alert when you're mentioned in someone's blog.    Moffitt and others speaking at the South By Southwest Interactive Festival on Saturday said there's not yet fully developed technology that would both give people all the real-time info they want and let people who put their information on the Internet select who sees it -- or even take it back.    \"It's kind of in our best interest, being selfish, if everyone was completely open with their data,\" said Scott Raymond, founder of Austin-based Gowalla, a location-based mobile app. \"From the user's perspective, it's kind of the opposite -- it's probably better to just stay selfish with your own data but consume everyone else's.    \"There's a whole lot of work that needs to be done on this and it hasn't been solved yet.\"    For example, if people on Twitter all set their feed to private, the popular trending-topics feature wouldn't work. Recently, Twitter, on which most users make their information open to everyone, hit a major milestone -- its 10 billionth tweet. Unfortunately, that tweet was by a user whose settings are private, so the curious will never know what the landmark message was.    Brett Slatkin, a software developer with Google, said a real-time Web would create numerous new opportunities -- among them, giving small, local retailers a chance to catch up with major online stores that capitalize on convenience.    \"If my corner store can say [to a customer online], 'Yes, I just got five rickshaw bags in stock and you wanted one -- you can just walk down here and get it,' it's a chance to change competition and commerce,\" he said.    On sites like Twitter, Gowalla and Foursquare, Google Buzz and Facebook, status updates already exist as elements of a real-time Web.    Developers note that the speed with which information travels on the Internet is already dramatically faster than it was just a couple of years ago -- before Twitter and location-based apps existed and before Facebook became a worldwide phenomenon.    \"This creates lots of interesting social scenarios,\" said Dare Obasanjo, of Microsoft. \"In the 'old days,' you would have written a blog post about something you did and I'd be like, 'Crap, I was in the next room.' \"    Multiple players, at both major Internet companies and new startups, are working on an Internet platform to \"real time\" the rest of the Web. That starts with faster searching.    Current search engines \"crawl\" around the Internet -- adding the material they find to their databases. But that can sometimes take awhile, particularly on smaller Web sites.    Then, there needs to be a universal system for pushing that information to the right people.    Obasanjo suggested there may eventually be a way for every new page of data on the Internet to have hashtags (#) similar to the ones used on Twitter to denote that a post is about a particular topic.    On the issue of privacy, Slatkin said developers could roll out a way for a person to set their online privacy settings in one place then have those settings apply on every Web site.    \"We're going to see a definition, at the technical level, of what sharing means,\" Slatkin said. \"I think we're going to solve it on the technical level first. Once we solve it technically, it'll be about how to actually implement it for users.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/591f667f6b3f6eb8f05e1a469990bdd499a096f4.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was Woods' low point?", "id": "107743", "answers": [{"text": "when he had to tell his wife, Elin", "answer_start": 924}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Tiger Woods said Sunday that he is focused on \"living a life of amends\" after \"living the life of a lie\" in one of his first interviews since a November car crash outside his home unleashed a media frenzy amid rumors of extramarital affairs.      The brief, five-minute interview on ESPN was one of two the professional golfer granted Sunday afternoon at the Isleworth golf club near his home outside Orlando, Florida. The Golf Channel simultaneously aired its similarly brief interview with Woods on Sunday night.      Woods credited inpatient and outpatient therapy for helping him start the process toward making amends.      \"It was tough,\" he told ESPN's Tom Rinaldi of the therapy. \"To look at yourself in a light that you never want to look at yourself, that's pretty brutal. ... I saw a person that I never thought I would ever become.\"      Woods said two of his lowest points in the past four months came when he had to tell his wife, Elin Woods, and his mother about his affairs.      \"Those are the two people in my life who I'm closest to, and to say the things that I've done, truthfully to them, is ... honestly ... was ... very painful,\" he said.      Woods told The Golf Channel's Kelly Tilghman that his mentor and father, the late Earl Woods, \"would be very disappointed in me.\"      \"I wish I could have had his guidance through all of this,\" he told Tilghman. \"Have him help straighten me up. I know he would have done it.\"      Despite the open nature of the interviews -- both Rinaldi and Tilghman weren't restricted on the questions they could ask  -- the notoriously private Woods declined to go into detail about the night of the November car crash, telling Rinaldi that \"it's all on the police report.\"      \"Beyond that, everything is between Elin and myself, and that's private,\" Woods said.      He also declined to specify what treatment he has been seeking, but did say it will continue despite his announcement last week that he will return to golf at the Masters next month.      \"I'm excited to get back and play,\" he told Rinaldi. \"I'm excited to get to see the guys again. ... I miss competing. But still, I still have a lot more treatment to do, and just because I'm playing, doesn't mean I'm gonna stop going to treatment.\"      When asked about what reaction he expects from the fans, Woods said: \"I don't know. I'm a little nervous about that to be honest with you. ... It would be nice to hear a couple claps here and there.

Rod Blagojevich, who was arrested this week on federal corruption charges relating in part to the selection of President-elect Barack Obama's successor as a U.S. senator.  Barack Obama says he has never spoken with Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich about the vacant Senate seat.  State Rep. John Fritchey, head of the House Civil Judiciary Committee, sent the letter Thursday asking Democratic colleagues to say by Friday whether they support a move for impeachment and would like to be added as a co-sponsor of legislation. Blagojevich also is a Democrat.  \"Faced with a significant budget shortfall, a national recession, and a vacant United States Senate seat, we cannot afford to allow Illinois to operate without effective leadership in the [Illinois] executive branch,\" said the letter, also signed by Reps. Thomas Holbrook, David Miller and James Brosnahan.  \"Simply put, it is imperative to replace Gov. Blagojevich as soon as is practicable.\"  The letter said the impeachment filing was being prepared, and the lawmakers said they expected the process -- the state House would bring charges against Blagojevich and he would be tried by the state Senate -- would take \"a matter of weeks rather than months.\"  The lawmakers' move coincided with increasing calls for Blagojevich's resignation.  President-elect Barack Obama called again Thursday for Blagojevich to step down, saying the embattled governor can no longer effectively serve the people of Illinois.  Watch as Obama says Senate seat belongs to the people \u00bb  \"I hope that the governor himself comes to the conclusion that he can no longer effectively serve and that he does resign,\" Obama said, speaking before announcing his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.  Obama said he was as \"appalled and disappointed as anyone\" by the allegations against the Democratic governor, and said he was confident his staff was not involved in the alleged scandal.  Federal officials said Blagojevich was looking to sell or trade Obama's open seat in the U.S. Senate.  Obama said he had never spoken to the governor on the subject, adding he was confident that \"no representatives of mine would have any part of any deals related to this seat.\"  He had asked his staff to gather the facts of any contacts with the governor's office about the vacancy, he said.  \"This Senate seat does not belong to any politician to trade. It belongs to the people of Illinois, and they deserve the best possible representation,\" he said. \"They also deserve to know that any vacancy will be filled in an appropriate way so that whoever is sent to Washington is going to be fighting for the people of Illinois.\"  Earlier Thursday, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said she is prepared to go to the Illinois Supreme Court to have Blagojevich declared unfit to serve if he does not resign.  Explainer: Federal complaint against Blagojevich \u00bb  \"Obviously the easiest way for us to move on in the state of Illinois is for Gov. Blagojevich to do the right thing for the people and to resign,\" she told CNN's \"American Morning.\"  She added, \"If he fails to, the two other options are obviously the Legislature moving forward on impeachment, or I have the opportunity to actually go to our Illinois Supreme Court and ask them to declare, basically, that our governor is unable to serve,\" she said.  In that case, Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, would become acting governor, she said.  Madigan said she won't wait long to take action.  \"We would like a signal from the Legislature if they're going to move forward on impeachment proceedings. ... I think there are obviously numerous members of the Legislature calling for impeachment proceedings,\" she said, noting that the Legislature, which is adjourned, will meet Monday to discuss the possibility of holding a special election for Obama's successor.  Fritchey, in the letter to Democratic lawmakers, commended Madigan's willingness to go to the Supreme Court, but said \"both the duration as well as the outcome of such a proceeding are inherently uncertain and speculative.\"  Watch what was in the complaint against Blagojevich \u00bb  \"We would also note the comments of the attorney general indicating her support of impeachment proceedings as an appropriate course of action at this time,\" the letter said.  Quinn said at a news conference earlier Thursday that the governor had lost the confidence of the people.  \"I think the governor has one duty right now and that's the duty to resign,\" he said.  Should he became governor, Quinn indicated he might lean toward appointing a successor to Obama's seat, saying an election would be expensive and time-consuming.  \"Time is of the essence for all of us in America right now, to make sure we get our economy on the straight path to recovery,\" he said.  Blagojevich -- who is free on his own recognizance -- returned to work Wednesday, his 52nd birthday. He has not commented on the charges, but his lawyer, Sheldon Sorosky, told reporters Tuesday night that his client \"feels he didn't do anything wrong.\"  Sorosky said, \"He hopes the people of Illinois have faith in him, because he will be vindicated.\"  White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said Thursday that President Bush believes the governor's arrest marks a \"very serious situation,\" and he believes the charges are \"astounding.\"  Some details of the alleged scandal became clearer Wednesday, as a law enforcement official close to the investigation identified Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. as the person referred to in the federal criminal complaint as Senate Candidate 5.  Of the six candidates mentioned in the complaint, Candidate 5 is the only one whom Blagojevich said engaged in discussion through an emissary about possibly raising money for the governor in exchange for the Senate position.  Jackson firmly denied wrongdoing at a Wednesday news conference. \"I reject and denounce 'pay to play' politics and have no involvement whatsoever in any wrongdoing,\" he said. \"I did not initiate or authorize anyone at any time to promise anything to Gov. Blagojevich on my behalf. I never sent a message or an emissary to the governor to make an offer, to plead my case or to propose a deal about a U.S. Senate seat. Period.\"  The law enforcement official said there was no evidence -- other than the governor's taped remarks -- that Jackson or others on his behalf ever approached the governor in an improper way.  The official also emphasized that no conversations with Jackson were picked up on bugs or wiretaps, and there is no evidence that he was aware of anything improper.  According to the complaint, Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris -- who was also arrested Tuesday on federal corruption charges -- were \"conspiring to obtain personal financial benefits\" for Blagojevich by leveraging his sole authority to appoint a U.S. senator to replace Obama.  Federal investigators also allege the two were trying to have Chicago Tribune editorial board members fired by leveraging state assistance to the parent company of the newspaper, the Tribune Company, in its sale of Wrigley Field.  Explainer: Illinois governor is in hot water \u00bb  The governor and his chief of staff are also accused of sullying other areas of state business: trying to rescind $8 million of state funds to Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital because the hospital's chief executive officer had not contributed $50,000 to Blagojevich, and expecting a highway contractor to raise $500,000 in contributions in exchange for money for a tollway project.  \"Because of the unimaginable allegations that were in the federal complaint, it really calls into question absolutely everything that the governor has authority to do,\" Madigan said Thursday on CNN's \"Situation Room.\"  She said she had spoken to the governor only once this year, and perhaps not at all last year.  Watch whom Blagojevich has considered \u00bb  \"That sounds incredible, because I do serve as attorney general, so I'm the lawyer for the state, but we've been well aware for years that there are problems with this governor and so I haven't had anything to do with him,\" she said.  She did not elaborate.  Quinn said earlier this week that he had not spoken to the governor since summer 2007.  Blagojevich and Harris are each charged with a count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and a count of solicitation of bribery, authorities said. iReport.com: Do you trust your leaders?

Ben Freeth's farm was gutted by fire, as was his father-in-law's.    The power-sharing agreement included an undertaking by both parties to ensure property rights are upheld but farm attacks and invasions continue unabated in Zimbabwe.    Charles Lock is one of an estimated 400 farmers who have remained in the country despite President Robert Mugabe's policy of redistributing white-owned farms to landless blacks.    \"Why do they want to remove me when I've complied with everything they want? What more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that's the case, then admit that that is the policy. Pass a law: no whites are allowed to farm. Then it makes it clear,\" Lock said.    Since 2000, Mugabe's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land, destroying Zimbabwe's once prosperous agricultural sector.    \"When the land reform program began, we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out. So I voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father-in-law's farm,\" Lock said.    That was in 2002. A year later the government came knocking on his door again, he said, demanding more land.    Lock told CNN he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father-in-law's farm, which he then owned. Now an army general is demanding Lock's remaining 30 percent.    When Zimbabwe's new unity government was formed -- with Mugabe's ZANU-PF and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change -- in February this year, the general allegedly posted soldiers on Lock's farm. The farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point.    When CNN visited Lock's farm this month, workers were standing idle. Maize and tobacco, which Lock said is worth more than U.S. $1 million, lay in storage.    \"They've switched off our irrigation system, taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize,\" he told CNN.    So Lock had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room. He took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted.    With the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but Lock said: \"Nothing is happening here. There is no land audit happening, no one comes out here to check, to see. We are just left vulnerable.\"    On another farm, Ben Freeth's fight for his land has just escalated to another level.    Freeth has been repeatedly beaten, arrested and harassed. Now his farmhouse and that of his father-in-law have been gutted by a mysterious fire. See the destruction the fire caused    Freeth could not say for sure that this is arson but told CNN that the group of ZANU-PF youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house.    \"One time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming. They were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you don't get out,\" he said.    Freeth and his father-in-law Mike Campbell are among a group of Zimbabwean farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern African tribunal.    But Mugabe has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal. Farmers cannot contest land issues in Zimbabwe and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either.    When CNN interviewed Mugabe's minister of state, Didymas Mutasa, about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms, he blamed the farmers for the violence, saying landless blacks are getting frustrated with their refusal to relinquish their land.    \"Human rights are beginning to be seen now because they benefit the whites, and when they were affecting blacks badly as they did the likes of us, it didn't matter and nobody raised anything about those human rights.    \"And sometimes we say, good heavens, if that is the kind of human rights you are talking about, you better keep them away from us; we don't want to see them,\" he told CNN.    But it is black farm workers who are caught in the cross fire. They continue to bear the brunt of the land reform program by repeatedly being beaten and intimidated. Some have even been killed.    Tractor driver William Kale said it is farm laborers working for white farmers who are targeted.    \"They actually say you the workers, you are ones that are supporting the white farmer. That is why he is carrying on farming and we refuse to go because we have nowhere to go,\" Kale told CNN.    Many farmers and farm workers we spoke to say they are in a worse position now under the unity government than they were before.    Lock said: \"When ZANU-PF was in power, you had hawks and doves in government and the doves were approachable and often helped us. But now that these positions are being shared with Mr. Tsvangirai's MDC, Mr. Mugabe has only appointed hawks to his cabinet who insist on continuing the land reform program. And when it comes to the MDC, the land issue seems to be a hot potato they do not want to touch. I have asked Mr. Tsvangirai to intervene but nothing is happening.\"    Prime Minister Tsvangirai refuted that. \"That is not true,\" he said. \"We initiated to find out who is being affected, the few remaining white farmers. Let's be frank here, we are talking of farmers as being white, but to me any destruction of farm production affects the whole viability of agriculture. There should be no disruption of any farm activity.\"    To those under siege these words are little comfort as they continue to fight a battle they are unlikely to win."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f2924c3501ec7d9b73c2c99bf0798d8a89f48cb0.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who else does she play?", "id": "107755", "answers": [{"text": "Bridget and her wealthy twin", "answer_start": 274}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- After an eight-year hiatus, Buffy is back!      Not really, but for some fans of Sarah Michelle Gellar it's the closest they can get at this point. The actress made her highly anticipated return to TV on Tuesday night in The CW's \"Ringer.\"      Playing ex-stripper Bridget and her wealthy twin sister Siobhan, Gellar's characters are a far cry from her days as the now-iconic vampire slayer on \"Buffy.\" But fans of the late supernatural series agree, they'd follow the actress just about anywhere: And that includes her new film noir-type soap.      Though The CW's programming tends to skew a bit younger, \"Ringer,\" which was originally created with CBS in mind, maintains a more adult quality. Potentially perfect for fans of Joss Whedon's cult hit, many of whom have likely matured with Gellar, now 34.      \"This is a good way for fans who loved 'Buffy' to sort of continue on with [Gellar],\" Hollywood.com's TV editor Kelsea Stahler said. \"Because they're older, I think it can appeal. We don't need vampires or werewolves or the forbidden love between her and Angel. You already love her. The drama is there.\"      The anticipation helps, too. Gellar went off the air on a high note after \"Buffy\" -- and stayed off.      Despite a TV movie, a couple of voiceovers on popular animated series and roles in two film franchises -- \"The Grudge\" and \"Scooby-Doo\" -- the actress chose to lay low while beginning a family with husband Freddie Prinze Jr. The pair welcomed their daughter Charlotte in September 2009.      \"The hiatus actually worked wonders for her,\" Stahler added. \"A lot of 'Buffy' fans were teens when 'Buffy' was first on. They grew up with her -- through 'Cruel Intentions,' 'The Grudge.' And when she went off the grid to do her family thing, people started to miss her as opposed to tossing her aside as a has-been.\"      Like TV bloggers and industry insiders predicted, \"Ringer\" reeled in a solid audience for The CW. However, its 2.7 million viewers don't quite compare to the 3 to 5 million viewers who tuned into The WB-turned-UPN to watch \"Buffy\" each week in the late '90s and early 2000s. But TV consumption is a different beast from when Gellar first graced the small screen. Anywhere in the 2 million viewers range is standard for programs on The CW, which spawned from the aforementioned networks.      \"'Buffy' fans are incredibly loyal,\" Daniel Malen, the editor of tvaddict.com, said before the show's premiere, adding, \"They're 100% going to watch 'Ringer.' ... I'm Sure The CW will be happy with [Tuesday's] numbers.\"      And Gellar's involvement isn't just appealing for viewers. Her \"Ringer\" co-stars are equally as thrilled to have her aboard.      \"When we knew Sarah Michelle was attached, that was the biggest draw to the project -- as much as the brilliant script that we both read,\" Ioan Gruffudd, who plays Siobhan's husband, said at Comic-Con. \"The package was just too attractive to turn down.\"      And as if \"Buffy\" fans weren't enough, throw in fans of \"LOST's\" Nestor Carbonell, who plays FBI agent Victor on the show.      \"It's smart casting,\" Stahler said. \"They've picked people who are really going to bring [viewers] along with them.\"      But, as Malen says, \"It's easy to get someone to tune in, but people have to enjoy the show. Whether or not the 'Buffy' fans stick around, we'll see.\"      Ryan McFadden, who runs buffyfans.com, said he's sure it will take some time before he can fully separate Gellar from Buffy in her new roles, but he's thrilled to welcome her back to TV.      Of course, he adds, there is a chance it won't live up to \"Buffy.\"      And Gellar knows it.      \"You can't top 'Buffy,' \" Gellar, who is also co-executive producer of her new series, told EW prior to \"Ringer's\" debut. \"There's no reason to try. It lives in that world, so you have to do something that's interesting for both the audience and for me as an actor. And that's not necessarily the easiest thing to find after a show like that.\"      Get more geeky news and musings at the CNN Geek Out blog      Perhaps unsurprisingly, \"Ringer\" was met with mixed reviews. The Hollywood Reporter is among the many outlets to compare Gellar's characters to Buffy, noting, \"[Gellar's performance] hardly lends confidence that she's capable of being the cornerstone of such a show.\" The consensus of most reviews being, \"give it a few episodes.\"      A boating scene shared by both of Gellar's characters attracted a good amount of negative criticism. Stationary clouds and calm water for miles backs the scene, which New York Magazine describes as \"the Sea of Bad Production Values.\"      \"They might have gotten stuck in the Comically Phony Visual Effects trade wind and been unable to navigate the difficult waters of the Fake Backdrop Strait,\" the article states.      But, for \"Buffy\" fan Kelly Creamer, Gellar can do no wrong.      \"I noticed [the green screen] a bit, but honestly, it was fine to me,\" she said. \"I mean, it didn't look that bad. ... It didn't affect the performance.\"      It's just nice to spend time with Gellar again each week, Creamer added. \"It feels like family -- the same kind of comfort.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/84ab5256295369509813877f5000bb7e01e7f641.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who died of an accidental overdose?", "id": "107758", "answers": [{"text": "Heath Ledger,", "answer_start": 190}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Federal drug investigators have taken over the inquiry into the January 22 death of actor Heath Ledger in a New York apartment, a law enforcement source told CNN Thursday.    Actor Heath Ledger, 28, died January 22 at an apartment in Lower Manhattan.    Ledger, 28, an Oscar-nominated Australian actor, died of an accidental overdose of six types of medication, according to the New York City medical examiner's office.    The medical examiner's office said Ledger \"died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine.\"    Oxycodone and hydrocodone are pain medications; diazepam -- also known as Valium -- is used to treat anxiety; temazepam is a sedative used to induce sleep; alprazolam -- known by the trade name Xanax -- is an anti-anxiety agent. Doxylamine, an antihistamine, can be obtained over the counter as a sleep aid.    The law enforcement source said the federal drug investigators are trying to determine if the drugs were prescribed legally, and are looking at two doctors -- one based in California and another in Texas.    Ledger's first American film was the teen comedy \"10 Things I Hate About You\" in 1999. He passed up several scripts before taking a role in the Revolutionary War drama \"The Patriot\" in 2000 and \"A Knight's Tale\" in 2001. He also played a supporting role in \"Monster's Ball.\"    But Ledger was perhaps best known for his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in \"Brokeback Mountain,\" Ang Lee's film about two cowboys who had a secret romantic relationship.

Gabriel Ferez (left) and Laurent Bonomo were graduate biochemistry students at London's Imperial College.      Nigel Farmer, 34, and Daniel \"Dano\" Sonnex, 23, were also found guilty of arson, false imprisonment and burglary.      The bodies of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, both 23, were found in Bonomo's burned apartment in southeast London last summer.      Ferez's mother, Francoise Villemont, told the judge that her son's killing was \"indescribable and inexcusable.\"      \"No human being deserves such a death,\" she said. \"My life stopped on the 29th June 2008. I feel battered and bruised as a mother forever scarred.\"      The lead detective in the case, Mick Duthie, said at the time that the two had fallen victim to a \"frenzied, brutal, horrific attack.\"      During a five-week trial, the jury heard details of how the two students were tied up for hours, tortured for their credit-card personal identification numbers and repeatedly stabbed in an early morning attack June 29, 2008.      Farmer went back to the apartment that night and set fire to it in an attempt to destroy the evidence, police said. Emergency services were called to the address after neighbors heard an explosion and saw flames leaping from the premises.      Investigators initially believed the French men died in the fire, but an autopsy showed each had been stabbed dozens of times in the head, neck and torso -- 196 times, in Bonomo's case and 47 times for Ferez.      Police believe they were bound during the assault and an accelerant was used to start the fire after they were killed.      Hand-held Sony portable games, mobile phones and credit cards were missing, police said.      Bonomo's card was used to withdraw \u00a3360 (about $580) in seven transactions. A bank machine seized Ferez's card when someone tried to use it.      Farmer turned himself in to police in the early hours of July 7, 2008, \"demanding to be seen and claiming to have committed a double murder. After hospital treatment, he was questioned for three days but chose to say nothing to police,\" Duthie said.      Police appealed to the public for tips, prompting someone to name Sonnex as someone \"with a propensity to use violence and whose family lived very close by,\" the police said in a statement.      Farmer and Sonnex were arrested in July.      Bonomo's father, Guy Bonomo, said he is \"tormented\" by images of his son's suffering. \"Not only have you taken Laurent's life, you've taken my heart and soul,\" he told Farmer and Sonnex.      \"I wish from the bottom of my heart that you will stay in prison for the rest of your lives. I can't bear to think that someone so evil will walk the streets again, that my daughter or a member of my family could encounter you again.\"      In court, each blamed the other for killing the two men, police said.      \"Throughout the case, neither has had the decency or courage to admit any part in the fatal assault on the two students with both men telling different stories and ultimately blaming each other,\" Duthie said. \"I'm sad to say that we have not yet heard what did happen that early morning.\"      The two men are due to be sentenced later Wednesday.      The victims were biochemistry graduate students on a three-month course at Imperial College, London, studying genetic developments. They were planning to return to France in July."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9b16935c95af8cf7a0256160a929c5c16319f19c.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What will she volunteer with?", "id": "107762", "answers": [{"text": "President Bush's HIV/AIDS relief program in Africa.", "answer_start": 3483}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on Friday said she would do the job again -- but only if she could work for her current boss.

Yes,\" Perino said. \"But would I ever come back and do this? No. ...

Perino said there are some things that she would have done differently.  \"I'm sure that I'll have lots,\" she said Friday when asked if she had any regrets. \"I'm going to go on a six-week trip with my husband, and I'm sure there will be long-enough flights for me to think about all the things we could have done better.

It's just a fact of life,\" she added.  As she begins to look beyond her years in the West Wing, Perino, a native of Wyoming who was raised in Colorado, says she is looking forward to spending more time in her own neighborhood in Washington with her husband, Peter McMahon, and their dog, a Hungarian Vizsla named Henry.

Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever.  So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night.  For foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night.  Daytime equation  1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20. \"Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist,\" suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look.  2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose.  3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. \"The color looks more natural and lasts longer.\" Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens ($10).  Nighttime equation  1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches.  2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores).  3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Robin Fredriksz, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores).  4. Brush on color for more control. Try: Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush ($35) with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red ($11).  Makeup artists' favorites  Just like us, cosmetics pros use the same lipsticks again and again. From the just right daytime rose to the classic evening red, here are some of their all-time go-to picks for day and night.  Carmindy's neutral picks for day are designed to \"enhance your natural lip color.\" For night she recommends dark berry or true red for all skin tones. Her clients: Heidi Klum and Jamie-Lynn Sigler.  Day shades: Benefit Silky Finish in Candy Store, $16; Givenchy Rouge Interdit in Secret Pink, $26.  Night colors: Nars in Scarlet Empress, $23; Revlon Super Lustrous in Love That Red, $8; at drugstores.  AJ Crimson likes a subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones during the day. For night he recommends bright red for fair complexions and a deep purple for darker ones. His clients: Missy Elliot and Amerie.  Day shades: Chanel Rouge Hydrabase in Pink Sugar, $25; Laura Mercier in Candy Pink, ($22).  Night colors: Maybelline Moisture Extreme in Royal Red, $7; at drugstores; MAC in Cyber, ($14).  Melissa Silver uses fuchsia on cool skin tones and peachy nude on warm ones for day. For night, she says, \"anyone can wear plum or sheer red.\" Her clients: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Cindy Crawford.  Day shades: Clinique Colour Surge Butter Shine in Fresh Watermelon, $14; Lanc\u00f4me Le Rouge Absolu in Nectariche, $25.

In an effort to pre-empt the results of NATO's official investigation, due out next week, the Pakistani Embassy in Washington invited reporters for a detailed briefing on the incident.      Pakistani military officials at the briefing contended that NATO forces knew they were firing at Pakistani troops throughout the attack and even apologized as they kept firing, evidence they say supports their assertions the attack was deliberate.      U.S. officials have said it was a regrettable case of mistaken identity and miscommunication when NATO attacked the area in support of a nearby U.S.-Afghan joint patrol that believed it was under fire from the Taliban.      \"I have a story to tell and this is the story of those brave people who left us in the middle of a cold, November night on a barren mountain top,\" a senior Pakistani defense official began.      Using maps, photos and PowerPoint charts, he offered a painstaking recreation of the incident from the Pakistani military's point of view, based on interviews with surviving troops and residents where the attack took place.      He and embassy officials at the briefing spoke on the condition of anonymity, preferring for their military and civilian leadership in Islamabad to speak on the record.      At issue is whether Pakistani troops were the target of the attacks.      The Pakistani officials at the briefing argued that well-established operating procedures and an intricate system for operational information sharing were deliberately ignored, which led to the tragic incident that killed 24 Pakistani \"martyrs.\"      American officials told CNN that U.S. forces checked first with their Pakistani counterparts before launching the strike. Before calling in airstrikes, the U.S. forces checked with a Pakistani liaison team. They were not seeking permission -- because the airstrikes were described as a matter of self-defense -- but were making sure Pakistani troops weren't in what was called a poorly marked border area, the officials said.      After that consultation, the U.S. believed there were no Pakistani forces nearby, which turned out not to be true.      U.S. military officials would not comment on the Pakistani assertions, citing the ongoing investigation. But in the past few weeks, U.S. officials have denied vehemently the charge by Pakistan's military that this was a deliberate attack.      \"What I can say, absolutely, and I can't imagine anyone in this room wouldn't believe me -- we did not attack a border post, a Pakistan military border post, intentionally,\" Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a speech in Washington last week. \"If you think we did, I'd have to ask you in return what in the world would we hope to gain by doing that? So I can say that categorically.      Dempsey said, \"They believe we did this intentionally in some way to either discredit them or goad them into further action.\"      Pentagon spokesman George Little said, \"We know enough at this point to say with certainty this was not an intentional attack on Pakistani forces. The Pakistanis are our partners; it defies reason that we would attack them.\"      But Pakistani officials at the embassy briefing said that not only were the coordinates incorrect, covering an area nine miles north of the attack, but Pakistan's chain of command was in the process of reviewing them when NATO helicopters began the striking Pakistani outpost \"Volcano\" shortly after midnight. Pakistan only returned fire after its first post was fired upon, which prompted NATO to strike against the second post, \"Boulder,\" the officials said, adding that the commanding officer who ran up the hill to the area with a rescue team was killed.      A NATO officer at the joint coordination outpost in the area even apologized to his Pakistani liaison in the middle of the attack for relaying the wrong location of the area NATO planes were about to fire on, preventing Pakistan from warning this was a friendly post, according to the Pakistani officials. Even after NATO officer acknowledged at about 1:15 a.m. that it was firing on the outposts and confirmed it was pulling back its helicopters, the Pakistanis maintain there was continued fire on the two posts by U.S. attack helicopters and an AC-130 gunship for about another hour until about 2:20 a.m. Neither claim could be verified with NATO and American officials.      Could NATO forces have mistaken the two border posts on the Afghan border for extremist bases, as U.S. officials have suggested?      Highly unlikely, the senior Pakistani defense official said at the briefing. First of all, the structures stood in plain view on the top of a barren ridge -- a place he said, which terrorists probably wouldn't be inclined to use as a hideout. Photos of both posts that suffered the attack show the structures made of stone and sandbags sitting on high ground.      A slide at the presentation called \"Mistaken Identity Not Possible\" tried to casts further doubt on the U.S. argument.      The slide detailed several ways Pakistan and its NATO counterparts keep track of each other's activities at the border.      The defense official claimed that NATO was even monitoring the Pakistani border posts' radio transmissions reporting it was under fire by NATO aircraft.      What's more, he said, the Pakistani military has shown its counterparts at several coordination centers maps of where it has outposts so as to avoid such misunderstandings.      \"It's something which just doesn't make any sense to me given the kind of coordination mechanism we have, the kind of information-sharing we have, given the fact that these locations are mutually known to both sides,\" he said.      The official would not speculate as to why NATO would deliberately attack two Pakistani outposts about 300 yards from the border, but would only say this was the official conclusion of the Pakistani leadership.      The incident has exacerbated an already fractious relationship between the United States and Pakistan, whose military has been on the defensive since the secret raid by U.S. Navy SEALs that killed Osama bin Laden in May.      Since the attack on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, close to Pakistani military installations, tensions have been at record levels. But last month's attack seems to have been the last straw, with Pakistan shutting NATO supply routes until it receives an official apology.      The United States has expressed \"condolences\" for the loss of the Pakistani soldiers but won't go as far as to issue an \"apology\" until the NATO investigation is complete. Pakistan has explicitly refused to coordinate with investigation, saying it doesn't trust NATO.      Regardless of the results of the investigation, officials say the incident has further solidified Pakistani military and public opinion against cooperation with NATO and the United States.      \"There is a sense of outrage,\" one senior official said. \"It's there on the street, amongst the leadership -- political as well as military -- and among the rank and file of the military. The sheer magnitude of this thing is unbelievable.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/be9b5dfb6df750f01b6e4288ef2d2854ce96c437.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is alleged to have offered her to undercover reporter?", "id": "107769", "answers": [{"text": "Rafiq Qureshi;", "answer_start": 598}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's child-rights watchdog has sought a report from police investigating allegations by a tabloid that the father of a \"Slumdog Millionaire\" child star tried to sell her to an undercover reporter, the watchdog's leader told CNN.

CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin says the U.S. Supreme Court may have to rule on the issue of same-sex marriage.  California's secretary of state late Tuesday released semi-official results showing Proposition 8 had passed 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent. CNN has not officially called the result one way or the other.  On Wednesday protesters took to the streets of Los Angeles to voice their opposition to the potential ban. And there are at least three legal challenges to it now pending in court.  Kiran Chetry of CNN's \"American Morning\" spoke Thursday with the program's legal analyst, Sunny Hostin, about the issue.  Chetry: California's attorney general says that the constitutional amendment is not retroactive, and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom says he will continue to marry people until someone sues him to stop. So what does Prop 8 mean first of all to people who want to get married in the state of California?  Hostin: Well, we already know in Los Angeles they are no longer issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. So in Los Angeles, it's a no go. In San Francisco, as you mentioned, the mayor is saying, \"We're still going to be doing it.\" So for people that aren't married yet, it's really legal limbo.  Chetry: All right. And what about people who from the time that they allowed same-sex marriage, this was in May until November, some 18,000 couples decided they were going to do it. What happens to them? Is their marriage still valid?  Hostin: It's still valid right now. But really they are also in a legal limbo. The bottom line it's all over the place. The law is really unclear here.  Last night, I was poring over these legal papers. I was also discussing this with a lot of law professors, a lot of different lawyers, and everyone is all over the place. Some folks said, you know, the bottom line is when you look at the language of Proposition 8, it is very clear that it was meant to be retroactive and that means that all the marriages will be invalidated.  Then another law professor that I spoke to said that is absolutely fundamentally ridiculous. The bottom line is this is a fundamental right that was given to couples and this is a right that is not going to be given away. I think we're going to see a lot of litigation here, Kiran, and the bottom line is everyone is in a legal, legal limbo.  Chetry: It's very interesting the grounds for which they are challenging. At least in one of these lawsuits they said that it was a constitutional revision rather than an amendment. And that means it would need two-thirds approval of the House in the legislature. So do we think it could go to the state house in California as well as being fought in the courts?  Hostin: I really think this is going to be a legal issue. I think this is going to go before the California Supreme Court. And we already know as you mentioned  that there are three cases pending before the California Supreme Court. And what is interesting to note is that it's the very same court that allowed these marriages in the first place.  And so, my guess is that that court is going to weigh in, probably reinstitute the right to marry for same-sex couples and then that's going to be likely based on the U.S. Constitution and our Supreme Court is going to weigh in.  What is I think extremely interesting here is that we now know that we have a president-elect, Obama. He's going to get the opportunity likely to appoint Supreme Court justices. So we don't even know which type of court or the makeup of the court that will hear this. But I think the Supreme Court will likely weigh in on this issue.  Chetry: This was such a hot button issue in the state. More spending on either side, $35 million, $37 million on both sides.  Hostin: Yes.  Chetry: It was the highest funded campaign on any state ballot.  Hostin: That's right.  Chetry: They say it trumped every other campaign except the presidential.  Hostin: People care about this issue. I mean, they're talking about discrimination, equal protection. It's an issue that's a hotbed issue.  We also know, Kiran, that in Arizona and Florida that this ban was implemented. And so, you know, it's all over the place. People care about this issue, and this is an issue that is really present. And I think that it's something that, we, of course, have to watch because we're talking about equal protection, we're talking about discrimination. People care about these issues.  Chetry: Sunny Hostin, great to see you. Thank you.  Hostin: Thanks. iReport.com: Did you vote on a same-sex measure?"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/7725386be50e432c4a787e692bc71064942da992.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what will include evidence?", "id": "107771", "answers": [{"text": "a recording of a phone conversation", "answer_start": 1971}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Steroid test results and notes and calendars from his then-trainer are among the evidence federal prosecutors have amassed in their perjury case against baseball home-run king Barry Bonds, according to documents unsealed Wednesday.    Barry Bonds, shown at his most recent court appearance, is accused of lying to a grand jury.    The 223-page stack of documents unsealed by a federal judge represents much of the government's case against Bonds, who is accused of obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury investigating the use of steroids in professional sports. Prosecutors say the test results show Bonds was using performance-enhancing substances -- including a then-undetectable designer drug -- at a time he denied knowingly using any.    Bonds' attorneys are seeking to keep much of that evidence out of court. The 44-year-old former San Francisco Giants slugger holds Major League Baseball's single-season and all-time home-run titles, but his achievements have been shadowed by allegations he used performance-enhancing drugs.    Bonds pleaded not guilty to the perjury and obstruction of justice charges and has been free on $500,000 bond. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday.    The charges stem from his 2003 appearance before a federal grand jury probing the distribution of steroids by the San Francisco-area Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative, or BALCO. Bonds told the grand jury that his former personal trainer, Greg Anderson, gave him a cream that he said was flaxseed oil to use on his arm in 2003.    Anderson spent three months in prison after admitting distributing steroids and was later jailed for refusing to cooperate with prosecutors. The case against Bonds will include calendars kept by Anderson that prosecutors say were used to keep Bonds and other athletes on a doping regimen -- an assertion expected to be bolstered by the testimony of other athletes, they said.    Evidence will include a recording of a phone conversation with an associate in which Anderson \"describes injecting the defendant, having the ability to obtain and utilize inside information about MLB's random drug testing to the defendant's benefit and the undetectable nature of what Anderson had been doing,\" according to documents.    Bonds won seven National League MVP titles during his 22-year career, 15 years of which was spent with the Giants.

Soueid, of Leesburg, Virginia, was charged October 5 with conspiring to collect video and audio recordings and other information about people \"in the United States and Syria who were protesting the government of Syria and to provide these materials to Syrian intelligence agencies in order to silence, intimidate and potentially harm the protestors,\" the Justice Department said Wednesday.      The Syrian Embassy in Washington responded Wednesday by denying the allegations, saying Soueid never worked for the Syrian government to spy on protesters.      Soueid was arrested Tuesday after a federal grand jury charged him in a six-count indictment.      He is charged with conspiring to act and acting as an agent of the Syrian government in the United States without notifying the attorney general as required by law; two counts of providing false statements on a firearms purchase form; and two counts of providing false statements to federal law enforcement, the Justice Department said.      This comes amid Syria's seven-month-long crackdown against protesters.      \"Today's indictment alleges that the defendant acted as an unregistered agent of the Syrian government as part of an effort to collect information on people in this country protesting the Syrian government crackdown. I applaud the many agents, analysts and prosecutors who helped bring about today's case,\" said Lisa Monaco, assistant attorney general for national security.      The indictment says Soueid has been an agent of the Syrian Mukhabarat, a reference to Syrian intelligence agencies.      \"At no time while acting as an agent of the government of Syria in this country did Soueid provide prior notification to the Attorney General as required by law, the indictment alleges,\" the Justice Department said.      \"Under the direction and control of Syrian officials, Soueid is accused of recruiting individuals living in the United States to collect information on and make audio and video recordings of protests against the Syrian regime -- including recordings of conversations with individual protesters -- in the United States and Syria. He is also charged with providing the recordings and other information to individuals working for the Mukhabarat. According to the indictment, Soueid and others conspired to use this information to undermine, silence, intimidate and potentially harm those in the United States and Syria who engaged in the protests.\"      In late June, the Syrian government paid for Soueid to travel to Syria. He met with intelligence officials and privately spoke with President Bashar al-Assad, the indictment said.      \"In addition to the recordings, Soueid is accused of providing the Mukhabarat contact information, including phone numbers and e-mail addresses, for protesters in the United States. In a handwritten letter sent to UCC-1 (an unindicted co-conspirator), Soueid allegedly expressed his belief that violence against protesters -- including raiding their homes -- was justified and that any method should be used to deal with the protesters. The indictment also alleges that Soueid provided information regarding U.S. protesters against the Syrian regime to an individual who worked at the Syrian Embassy in Washington, D.C.\"      In a statement, the Syrian Embassy challenged the Justice Department to provide evidence of the allegations. It said Soueid is not an agent of any Syrian institution and has never worked for any Syrian official.      The allegation that any U.S. citizen is working with Syria to intimidate other U.S. citizens is \"absolutely baseless and totally unacceptable,\" the embassy said.      Syria never paid Soueid for travel or any other expense, the embassy said. It also denied there had ever been a private meeting between Soueid and al-Assad, calling it a \"ludicrous\" accusation.      It also said the embassy had never recruited anyone to inform on any activities in the United States.      \"Contrary to the statement of the Department of Justice, Mr. Soueid has never provided any individual at the Syrian Embassy in the U.S. with any information regarding U.S. protesters or otherwise,\" it said. \"This is a flagrant effort to defame the Embassy of Syria based on sheer lies and fabrications.\"      The indictment also said FBI agents interviewed Soueid and he is accused of lying \"when he denied that he had collected information on U.S. persons and transmitted that information to the government of Syria.\"      \"In addition, Soueid allegedly made further false statements when he denied to FBI agents that he had directed someone to audio or videotape a conversation, meeting, rally or protest, or that he was aware of any individual taking photographs or videotaping people. He also allegedly made false statements when he denied that he had ever been an agent of the Syrian government or a foreign intelligence officer.\"      \"The ability to assemble and protest is a cherished right in the United States, and it's troubling that a U.S. citizen from Leesburg is accused of working with the Syrian government to identify and intimidate those who exercise that right,\" said Neil MacBride, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. \"Spying for another country is a serious threat to our national security, especially when it threatens the ability of U.S. citizens to engage in political speech within our own borders.\"      If Soueid is convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison.      Soueid is also known as Anas Alswaid, the Justice Department said.      Alswaid had been named in a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Syrian citizens or Syrian-Americans who say they have been subjected to abuse or are family members of those who have been abused by the defendants. Along with Alswaid, the defendants include the Syrian Arab Republic, the Ministry of State Security Intelligence, al-Assad's brother Maher, the Syrian ambassador to the U.S., Imad Moustapha, and others.      The suit was filed in May.      \"Alswaid is an integral part of the criminal conspiracy to torture, maim, and kill Syrians. Through his efforts, the al-Assad regime learns the identities of Syrians based in the United States, who are trying to assist in the efforts to counteract the tactics of the al-Assad regime. He transmits such information to Damascus to initiate criminal conduct against the families of the identified Syrians,\" the suit alleges.

For some businesses, that means bringing out a fighter brand -- a cut-price version of a flagship product, marketed under a new name, and intended to fight back against budget competitors.    \"Jetstar\" is a fighter brand that worked, beating the competition and creating a lasting, money-making brand.    When it's done right it can destroy cut-price competition, but done badly it can drive a business to the brink of bankruptcy.    Mark Ritson, associate professor at Melbourne Business School, has written an article for the October issue of Harvard Business Review discussing the benefits and pitfalls of launching a fighter brand.    He says that over the next six months a number of new fighter brands are likely to appear in response to the recession.    \"Fighter brands are very unusual but they are becoming increasingly common,\" he told CNN. \"It's high risk and high reward, and when it works it can have astonishing results.\"    Ritson gives the example of Intel, which launched its budget \"Celeron\" chip in the late 1990s to in response to AMD's low-priced chips, which were threatening Intel's premium \"Pentium\" brand.   Read more business features  With \"Celeron,\" Intel came up with a budget alternative to \"Pentium\" for the lower end of the market and cemented its position as market leader.    But Intel's success is the exception rather than the rule. \"The majority of fighter brands not only haven't worked, but have gone on to do significant damage to the companies that launched them,\" said Ritson.    General Motors' (GM) \"Saturn,\" United Airlines' \"Ted,\" and Kodak's \"Funtime\" film range are all high-profile fighter brands that failed. Despite the appeal of taking on the competition in a fist fight, launching a successful fighter brand is easier said than done.    \"The problem is that fighter brands are almost always a knee-jerk reaction to a problem and are not always well thought out,\" Neil Saunders, consulting director with Verdict Research, told CNN.    Ritson says one element in building a fighter brand is to avoid creating a low-price product that is so attractive that it steals customers who would otherwise be buying that company's premium-brand product.    On the other hand, if the fighter brand is too expensive or too low quality, it won't put up much of a fight against the opposition it's designed to attack.    Another complication is that even the biggest companies don't have the money and managerial time to distract themselves with a new brand at a time when they should be concentrating on their core products, and then there is the difficulty in operating at an unfamiliar low price level.    \"The airline industry is a prime example, where people have launched fighter brands to combat the budget airlines and have been notoriously unsuccessful,\" said Saunders. \"If it's not your business model it's not easy to operate, and it's not usually these airlines' business model.\"    United's \"Ted,\" and Delta Air Lines \"Song\" were launched to combat budget carriers, but they weren't up to the challenge. In fact, Ritson says those fighter brands contributed to United and Delta's bankruptcy.    But with its budget \"Jetstar\" airline, Qantas managed to find the holy grail for fighter brands -- beating the competition and creating a lasting, money-making brand in its own right. So what was different about the Qantas model?    \"One thing was that Qantas took a long, hard look at the numbers and decided if they could be profitable,\" said Ritson. \"One of the problems with fighter brands is that they are oriented towards destroying a competitor and because of that managers pay a lot less attention to the bottom line.\"    He gives the example of GM's \"Saturn,\" a car designed to take on fuel-efficient, affordable Japanese cars. \"Saturn\" sold plenty of cars, at least at first, but its high operating costs meant it lost millions of dollars, playing a huge part in bankrupting GM.    So given the huge risks involved, should companies even consider launching a fighter brand?    \"Only do it if you can win and it fits with your existing proposition,\" says Saunders.    Ritson cautions, \"The minute you add a new brand to your portfolio it's hundreds of thousands of hours of management time, and millions of dollars in development, advertising and distraction.    \"Ask the question, 'do I need a fighter brand or is this a real seismic change in the market, which means I need to change my existing strategy with existing brands?' Otherwise you will lose five years and $50 million.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/d6f2107232b665a55fac6605a81e8261330f9520.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many engineers are designing a space elevator?", "id": "107784", "answers": [{"text": "more than 300 scientists and", "answer_start": 2458}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new space race is officially under way, and this one should have the sci-fi geeks salivating.  Lift to space: This is a NASA interpretation of what a space elevator may look like.  The project is a \"space elevator,\" and some experts now believe that the concept is well within the bounds of possibility -- maybe even within our lifetimes.  A conference discussing developments in space elevator concepts is being held in Japan in November, and hundreds of engineers and scientists from Asia, Europe and the Americas are working to design the only lift that will take you directly to the one hundred-thousandth floor.  Despite these developments, you could be excused for thinking it all sounds a little far-fetched.  Indeed, if successfully built, the space elevator would be an unprecedented feat of human engineering.  A cable anchored to the Earth's surface, reaching tens of thousands of kilometers into space, balanced with a counterweight attached at the other end is the basic design for the elevator.  It is thought that inertia -- the physics theory stating that matter retains its velocity along a straight line so long as it is not acted upon by an external force -- will cause the cable to stay stretched taut, allowing the elevator to sit in geostationary orbit.  The cable would extend into the sky, eventually reaching a satellite docking station orbiting in space.  Engineers hope the elevator will transport people and objects into space, and there have even been suggestions that it could be used to dispose of nuclear waste. Another proposed idea is to use the elevator to place solar panels in space to provide power for homes on Earth.  If it sounds like the stuff of fiction, maybe that's because it once was.  In 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's novel \"The Fountains of Paradise\" brought the idea of a space elevator to a mass audience. Charles Sheffield's \"The Web Between the Worlds\" also featured the building of a space elevator.  But, jump out of the storybooks and fast-forward nearly three decades, and Japanese scientists at the Japan Space Elevator Association are working seriously on the space-elevator project.  Association spokesman Akira Tsuchida said his organization was working with U.S.-based Spaceward Foundation and a European organization based in Luxembourg to develop an elevator design.  The Liftport Group in the U.S. is also working on developing a design, and in  total it's believed that more than 300 scientists and engineers are engaged in such work around the globe.  NASA is holding a $4 million Space Elevator Challenge to encourage designs for a successful space elevator.  Tsuchida said the technology driving the race to build the first space elevator is the quickly developing material carbon nanotube. It is lightweight and has a tensile strength 180 times stronger than that of a steel cable. Currently, it is the only material with the potential to be strong enough to use to manufacture elevator cable, according to Tsuchida.  \"At present we have a tether which is made of carbon nanotube, and has one-third or one-quarter of the strength required to make a space elevator. We expect that we will have strong enough cable in the 2020s or 2030s,\" Tsuchida said.  He said the most likely method of powering the elevator would be through the carbon nanotube cable.  So, what are the major logistical issues keeping the space elevator from being anything more than a dream at present?  Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics and astronautics Professor Jeff Hoffman said that designing the carbon nanotube appeared to be the biggest obstacle.  \"We are now on the verge of having material that has the strength to span the 30,000 km ... but we don't have the ability to make long cable out of the carbon nanotubes at the moment.\" he said. \"Although I'm confident that within a reasonable amount of time we will be able to do this.\"  Tsuchida said that one of the biggest challenges will be acquiring funding to move the projects forward. At present, there is no financial backing for the space elevator project, and all of the Japanese group's 100-plus members maintain other jobs to earn a living.  \"Because we don't have a material which has enough strength to construct space elevator yet, it is difficult to change people's mind so they believe that it can be real,\" he said.  Hoffman feels that international dialogue needs to be encouaraged on the issue. He said a number of legal considerations also would have to be taken into account.  \"This is not something one nation or one company can do. There needs to be a worldwide approach,\" he said.  Other difficulties for space-elevator projects include how to build the base for the elevator, how to design it and where to set up the operation.  Tsuchida said some possible locations for an elevator include the South China Sea, western Australia and the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. He said all of those locations usually avoided typhoons, which could pose a threat to the safety of an elevator.  \"As the base of space elevator will be located on geosynchronous orbit, [the] space elevator ground station should be located near the equator,\" he said.  Although the Japanese association has set a time frame of the 2030s to get a space elevator under construction -- and developments are moving quickly -- Hoffman acknowledges that it could be a little further away than that.  \"I don't know if it's going to be in our lifetime or if it's 100 or 200 years away, but it's near enough that we can contemplate how it will work.\"  Building a space elevator is a matter of when, not if, said Hoffman, who believes that it will herald a major new period in human history.  \"It will be revolutionary for human technology, and not just for space travel. That's why so many people are pursuing it,\" he said. \"This is what it will take to turn humans into a space-bearing species.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/abc35b4f5be9a792684af5a0afd0251739aaf8d2.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does Sheena Iyengar believe about assisted suicide", "id": "107786", "answers": [{"text": "devaluing life", "answer_start": 4040}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- In his essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus,\" Albert Camus writes, \"Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.\" It is not a question we like to think about.      The default assumption is that life is always worth living, that it is sacred and should be treated as such. When that assumption is challenged, we find ourselves confused, afraid and -- in some cases -- angry.      The new HBO film \"You Don't Know Jack\" probably won't spur serious investigation of the fundamental question. This biopic of Jack Kevorkian, the infamous \"Dr. Death,\" may not add anything new to the physician-assisted suicide argument, but it does remind us of a time not too long ago when we were forced to consider where we stand on the matter. And for many of us, where we stand is anything but firm ground.      We believe in choice. We believe in self-determination. In fact, we prize them; we promote them; we preach about them. There aren't a lot of situations in which we're willing to take choice away from people, even if they would benefit from it.      My research suggests that Americans hold on tighter to choice than just about anyone else.      In one study, my collaborators Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali and I interviewed French and American parents who were coping with a tragic loss. Each couple had recently lost a severely ill baby after life support had been removed. In France, the doctors made the decision to remove life support; in America, the parents had the final say. The outcome was the same for all the parents, so did they have similar reactions?      Even up to a year later, the American parents expressed a great deal more negative emotion than the French parents. The French made statements like this: \"Noah was here for so little time, but he gave us so much, a new perspective on life.\"      American parents, by contrast, said things like, \"I keep thinking to myself,  'What if I had chosen differently?' I feel as though I've played a role in an execution.\"      Although the American parents were more miserable having made the choice themselves, they would not contemplate doing otherwise. When they were asked whether they would have preferred to have the doctor make the decision, they all said no. They felt trapped by choice, and yet they insisted on it.      If we can choose to take others off life support, choose to forgo medical treatment for ourselves, choose not to be resuscitated, and if these are choices we passionately defend, why do we balk at the choice of assisted suicide? There is legitimate concern about the potential for abuse, but we're tripped up by more than just the practical problems. We ask, \"Doesn't assisted suicide devalue life?\" We express what we can't quite articulate by saying that it feels wrong.      In an interview with Barbara Walters, as shown in the film, Kevorkian argues that medical practices often seem wrong before they become right. He says that ether wasn't used as an anesthetic for hundreds of years, that patients remained awake during surgery, \"because of the foolish notion that there's a God Almighty who wills us to suffer.\" Whether this is a fact or not, there is truth in it; we want our suffering to have purpose.      According to Camus, \"Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering.\"      When we reject assisted suicide, we reject that \"recognition.\" We need the habit of life to have meaning, we need suffering to have meaning, and we certainly need death to have meaning. And we think of choice as a way of making meaning, not taking it away.      Actively choosing to die -- leaving no part of it to chance or other forces -- strikes us as not only devaluing life but devaluing death and devaluing choice. In order to have a serious conversation about assisted suicide, we may need to accept that sometimes choice, death and the choice of death don't lead to or reveal anything greater. I don't know if we're ready for that. I don't know if we should be.

China's He Kexin kisses her gold medal last week after winning the Olympic women's uneven bars.    The committee asked the International Gymnastics Federation to clarify the situation, said spokeswoman Giselle Davis. She said she wouldn't call it a formal investigation.    The Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Summer Olympics Games. Five members won medals in individual competitions.    Yet commentators, bloggers and others have raised questions about whether about half the members of China's team were old enough to compete -- athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place.    In women's gymnastics, younger teenage girls can have an advantage over older competitors due to their often smaller, more agile bodies and lighter frames.    \"We have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number questions and apparent discrepancies on this case,\" Davis said.    A top Chinese Olympic official said questions regarding the ages of the athletes have been dealt with previously.    \"The eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and authorized by the international federation and, if they hadn't been cleared, they wouldn't have participated in the games,\" said Wang Wei, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic Committee.    Chinese officials provided the Olympic committee with passports, showing that team members were of legal age, but numerous challenges have been made.    The latest came from a blogger known as \"Stryde Hax.\" The blogger claims to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14.  Watch bloggers question China's gymnasts \u00bb    In Internet searches, \"Stryde Hax\" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He. That would make her 14 -- too young to compete in the Olympic Games.    CNN has not been able to independently verify the information, but snapshots of the Web pages appear to back up the claim. Other bloggers have joined the search and reported similar results.    The New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994.    \"According to online sports registration lists in China, half the team - He Kexin, Yang Yilin, Jiang Yuyuan - would be under age,\" the Times reported in July.    The International Gymnastics Federation, however, has said that those gymnasts were eligible and that the ages on their passports were correct.    Chinese gymnastics coaches defended their team Friday.    \"Our athletes participating in these games all conform to the age regulations of the Olympics,\" said Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's and women's teams.    \"Asians have different figures than people from the West, so that's what caused their suspicion,\" Huang said, referring to media inquiries. \"They shouldn't be suspicious.\"    CNN's John Vause contributed to this story"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/0845e239a23e627a48fee743c45b8c80c6eb56c4.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When does it start", "id": "107792", "answers": [{"text": "within 30 days.", "answer_start": 743}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity.    Rifqa Bary, 17, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July. She claims her father threatened to kill her.    The 17-year-old girl, Rifqa Bary, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July and took refuge in the home of the Rev. Blake Lorenz with the Global Revolution Church in Orlando, Florida.    Bary's parents want her back home.    At a court hearing Thursday in Orlando, the girl's parents denied all the allegations against them.

The judge had previously ruled that the girl will remain in Florida foster care until the allegations are resolved.    The parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, could not attend the hearing in person but listened through a telephone conference as their lawyer spoke for them.

It was Ladies' Night in a Boys' Town.      Yes, the opening routine by Baldwin and Steve Martin was very funny; there was sincerity and genuine gratitude from many of the winners; despite weird digressions into arcane areas like sound recording, the program moved briskly enough.      But did the orchestra need to follow Bigelow's win of her long-deserved best director prize, for \"The Hurt Locker,\" by playing the old Helen Reddy song \"I Am Woman\"?      When Zoe Saldana and Carey Mulligan arrived on stage to present the Best Original Song award, did they have to be intro-ed with \"Thank Heaven For Little Girls\"?      And in addition to being groped by Baldwin, did Bigelow have to be so muscled-in-on by her fellow producers when she was picking up the best picture award for her film, \"The Hurt Locker\"?      'The Hurt Locker' wins six Oscars      Maybe that wacky Elinor Burkett had a point: The producer of \"Music by Prudence\" -- which had just won the Oscar for best documentary short -- barreled on stage, saying \"Let the woman speak!\" and commandeering the mike from her director, Roger Ross Williams.      She provided a classic moment of Oscar craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes. Burkett seemed boorish, sure. But that doesn't necessarily make her wrong.      The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences certainly faced a dilemma this year: Vote for the future, or make up for the past.      Years from now, it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that \"Avatar,\" one of the biggest movies ever -- and, more importantly, the one that indicates where movies are going -- didn't win the top prize when Hollywood had a chance to bestow it.      Instead, the Oscars gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize.      What helped make it all so complicated was not that there's been a long, long history of overlooked genius female directors that the Oscars had to atone for.      The sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct.      Predictably, Bigelow didn't have to be as good as the boys, she had to be better. And she was.      But earning your Oscars and actually getting them are two different things. Fortunately for Bigelow, she had history on her side last night.      James Cameron didn't.      The billions being made by \"Avatar\" will probably be some consolation, but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy, which is what the Academy voters like.      In fact, the big-hearted, sentimental acceptance by best actor Jeff Bridges (\"Crazy Heart\"), and the rather elegant, funny remarks by best actress Sandra Bullock (\"The Blind Side\"), are exactly what we all want Oscar night to be.      That, and a few good jokes, which is what Martin and Baldwin provided, arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring Neil Patrick Harris that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer Alan Carr and the notorious Rob Lowe/Snow White musical overture of 1989.      Looking back on Oscar's 'train wreck'      Nothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night, although there were a few moments of bad choices, bad manners and a strategy that was, at best, elusive.      For all the changing characters and categories on Oscar-watchers' betting pool ballots, there are certain things we bet on no matter what: one, that the show will be interminable; two, that it will last at least until midnight (ET) no matter how they try to contain it; and, three, that there will be moments in the show itself that, although planned by seemingly sane individuals, will be inexplicable, if not grotesque.      Last night did not disappoint. While someone like poor Tivi Magnusson got drowned out by the orchestra (after he and Joachim Back won best live action short for \"The New Tenants\"), the show's producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable, unspeakable interpretive dance number, this one devoted to the evening's musical scores.      More painful, at least to this viewer's eyes, was an overlong salute to the late director John Hughes, featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players, a few of whom -- Molly Ringwald, for instance, and Judd Nelson -- looked positively shell shocked.      The only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category: The Argentine \"El Secreto de Sus Ojos,\" beat out the favored \"White Ribbon,\" thus continuing the Oscar tradition of giving the foreign-film prize to something few have even seen (a foreign-film Oscar doesn't do much good, one should remember, for a movie that's already opened and closed).      The other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer Sandy Powell accepted her \"Young Victoria\" Oscar.      \"I've already got two of these,\" she said, before dissing her coworkers and, by extension, the Academy in toto.      Brusque dismissal is not a quality Oscar tolerates very well and it's not likely Ms. Powell will be back, unlike Martin and Baldwin, who were the funniest Oscar hosts ever, proving there's power in numbers, the sum often can be more than the parts, and that it's always good to have an extra pair of hands, as long as they stay off Kathryn Bigelow's butt.      The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Anderson."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/37044ab8d7a8fc8f8026f0353ad09747b22954cd.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What happened to the journalist?", "id": "107796", "answers": [{"text": "he was killed.", "answer_start": 223}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Attackers in a Taliban-controlled area of Pakistan shot and tried to behead a Pakistani journalist on Wednesday, according to his employer GEO TV.    Mosa Khankhel was reporting for GEO TV when he was killed.    The slain correspondent, Mosa Khankhel, had been covering the recent peace deal between the Pakistani government and Taliban militants in Swat Valley when he was killed, GEO TV managing director Azhar Abbas said.    \"He is the first martyr of this peace deal,\" Abbas said, adding that he believes it is unlikely the deal will end the campaign of violence that has centered in Swat.    Khankhel was traveling in a caravan with Sufi Mohammed, who was leading the peace deal negotiations for the Taliban, when he went missing, Abbas said.    His body was found about an hour later. He had been shot three times and his killers had attempted to cut off his head.    Abbas called on Pakistan's government to fully investigate the killing of Khankhel, who was the network's correspondent based in North West Frontier Province as part of GEO TV's Peshawar bureau.    His death comes a day after Pakistan's government recognized the Taliban's interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, in the entire Malakand Division, which includes Swat and its surrounding district.  Watch questions raised by Khankhel's death \u00bb    The agreement marked a major concession by Pakistan in its attempt to hold off Taliban militants who have terrorized the region with beheadings, kidnappings, death threats, and the destruction of girls' schools.    The regional government in the Swat valley struck the deal to allow sharia law, in return the Taliban agreed to a 10-day cease fire.    The Taliban control of Swat -- which is about 100 miles northwest of Islamabad -- is the deepest advance by militants into Pakistan's settled areas, which are located outside its federally administered tribal region along the border with Afghanistan.    The peace deal is the latest attempt by Pakistan's civilian government -- which took power last year -- to achieve peace through diplomacy in areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein.    But analysts as well as critics within the establishment have warned that Pakistan's previous dealings with the Taliban have only given the fundamentalist Islamic militia time to regroup and gain more ground.    Khadim Hussain, a professor Bahria University in Islamabad who studies Pakistani politics, said the government has set the stage for two contradictory, parallel states in North West Frontier Province.    \"If you leave them like that and you give ... a semblance of peace in a particular area, what does that mean?\" Hussain said. \"It means you're capitulating. It means you're surrendering the state to them. It means your submitting the state authority to them because they are running a parallel state.\"    He said the government's decision amounts to a marriage of convenience made under duress.    Swat has been overrun by forces loyal to Maulana Fazlullah's banned hardline Islamic group, Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi (TNSM) which has allied itself with Taliban fighters.    TNSM was once led by Sufi Mohammed, Fazlullah's father-in-law, who is leading the latest negotiations.    Sufi Mohammed was released from jail last year by Pakistani authorities after he agreed to cooperate with the government. He was jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan.    Fazlullah took over TNSM during Sufi Mohammed's jail stint and vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region.    Last May, Pakistan's government announced it reached a peace deal with militants in Swat Valley.    In the months that have followed, the Taliban have seized control of the region and carried out a violent campaign against government officials, including local politicians.    The head of the secular Awami National Party -- which represents the region -- was forced to flee to Islamabad amid death threats from the Taliban.    Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders, blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants.    The United States -- using unmanned drones -- has carried out several airstrikes inside Pakistan on suspected militant targets, including one on Monday that killed at least 15 people, Pakistani sources said.    Such airstrikes, which sometimes result in civilian casualties, have aggravated tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan.    Pakistan's military operation in the region is unpopular among Pakistanis, but efforts to deal diplomatically with militants have not worked in the past.    Pakistan's previous leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, reached a cease-fire deal with militants in South Waziristan in 2006 which was widely blamed for giving al Qaeda and Taliban a stronger foothold in the region.

Actress Natasha Richardson died after suffering an epidural hematoma in a fall during a ski lesson.  But what she may not have known is some doctors have been arguing that if a person here is in need of urgent care at a medical trauma center, he or she may not be able to get there fast enough. The only way to get to the closest trauma center from here is to drive 2\u00bd hours to Montreal. No helicopter medical service is available.  The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail obtained 911 recordings from Monday, March 16, when Richardson fell on a beginners slope on a sunny, clear day at the resort. The first request for help came in at 12:43 p.m., an urgent call that a woman had fallen on the slopes. That woman was Richardson. Seventeen minutes later, at 1 p.m., an ambulance arrived, but Richardson had been able to walk away from the fall and was headed back to her hotel room.  Ten minutes later the ambulance was told to stand down, the call canceled.  What Richardson couldn't have known is that she suffered an epidural hematoma. It's a condition where a blood clot forms between the skull and the outer layer of the brain. Too much pressure can cause brain damage and even death. Symptoms include dizziness, headaches and nausea.  \"The person seems to be fine and walks it off, and that's one of the problems with an injury such as this,\" said Dr. Liam Durkan, a neurologist with the Montreal Neurology Institute. \"Anytime there is any sort of process expanding in the skull, which is a closed space, once the symptoms are apparent, it can be a matter of 30 minutes to an hour to 90 minutes before there is a major deterioration.\"  Two hours after her initial fall, while Richardson was back in her hotel room, she was feeling the symptoms. The clock was ticking and she needed to get to a trauma center fast. With the closest trauma center 2\u00bd hours away, time may have been running out on her. It's recommended that anyone with an epidural hematoma get to the trauma center within 30-90 minutes.  At 2:59 p.m., another ambulance was dispatched to the resort. This time, the paramedics went inside and worked on Richardson for 33 minutes before transporting her to the closest hospital an hour away, but it is not a trauma center. Inside the ambulance, Richardson drifted in and out of consciousness.  \"It is a rapidly deteriorating situation and the distance might have been just too much by ambulance, road ambulance or air ambulance. It's difficult to say,\" said Durkan, who did not treat Richardson. Depending on the severity of the injury at the time, he said, even helicopter services may have been too late.  Some trauma doctors have argued for air transport here since the mid-1990s. They say the safest and fastest way to move anyone suffering a trauma injury such as Richardson's is by helicopter. Helicopter transport is common practice in the United States and other areas of Canada. But in the Quebec region, very few places have access to air transport.  In an open letter to the citizens of Quebec sent to the Montreal Gazette, Dr. Michael Churchill Smith, director of professional services at the Montreal General Hospital, said incidents like Natasha Richardson's should serve as a wake-up call to Quebec. \"It is no longer morally acceptable for our citizens who, in the moment of their greatest needs, do not have access to a rapid transit system that gives them the best chance to not only survive, but to survive with a quality of life.\"  Daniel LeFrancois, director of Quebec's pre-hospital care, told the Gazette that cost is prohibitive when a one-hour flight costs $6,000. It's a question of resources and priorities focusing on \"the biggest gain for the biggest need,\" he said.  Richardson was taken from Mont Tremblant to a hospital in St. Agathe, which does not have the facilities to help someone with a severe head trauma. Richardson was transferred to the trauma center in Montreal about 7 p.m., more than six hours after her initial fall. Twenty-four hours later she was flown to a New York hospital, where she was taken off life support and died.  No one can answer the question whether a helicopter service could have saved Richardson's life. She refused services immediately after her fall, but with the clock ticking immediately after she felt symptoms from her injury, 2\u00bd hours may have been too far away even if she'd gotten help immediately."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/e7f13b23724311d9bd63358f560aa5f2a3dd6e30.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What affects troop morale?", "id": "107799", "answers": [{"text": "access to healthy foods, local cuisine and packages of snacks sent by friends and family", "answer_start": 792}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- When Command Sgt. Maj. Michael T. Hall of the International Security Assistance Force announced that fast-food offerings like Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen and Orange Julius were being shuttered in Afghanistan, he was blunt about it.      \"This is a warzone, not an amusement park,\" he wrote on the ISAF blog.      These mobile restaurants and others that can be found on large bases in Kandahar and Bagram, are \"nonessentials\" and are being shut down to streamline delivery of much-needed battlefield supplies.      However, according to some soldiers and Marines -- all of whom have served in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan -- access to the familiar hometown mall fare isn't as important to morale as many civilians may have thought.      The veterans and active-duty troops all said that access to healthy foods, local cuisine and packages of snacks sent by friends and family trumped military base fast food as morale boosters.      The announcement of the fast-food outposts' shuttering inspired a lively debate on CNN's Afghanistan blog about morale and the amenities afforded servicemen and women serving overseas -- often in harm's way. Those affected, however, didn't seem very concerned.      \"The big things that improve morale in a combat zone are lots of letters and packages from loved ones,\" Marine Cpl. David Brian Crouch said.      Especially appreciated in these care packages are sweet, sour, salty and spicy condiments, such as Tabasco, sugar packets and seasoned salts for enlivening the military's frequently derided Meals Ready to Eat -- individually packaged rations for service members stationed away from meal preparation facilities.      These high-calorie MREs, which have long drawn criticism for depressingly bland flavors and textures, are precisely what Crouch, who served two tours in Iraq, says drove his fellow troops to seek out more flavorful, familiar fast food.      Others look a little closer to their temporary home, sampling the local fare. While many soldiers out on combat patrols were, according to Army Capt. David Swaintek, \"too tired and drained to care much about their meal,\" he developed a taste for Iraqi flavors during his tour, which lasted from 2002 to 2008.      While he stands up for food on base, calling it \"decent\" and \"healthier\" than fast-food alternatives, he still misses his favorite flatbread, which he'd buy while out on patrol, and he laments not being able to find anything like it stateside.      Similarly adventurous, previously deployed Marines now at California's Camp Pendeleton don't have to venture far from their barracks to indulge in the Middle Eastern-style specialties they've come to love. According to the Marine Corps Times, DedeMed's Shawarma House now serves the eponymous gyro-like sandwich -- as well as hummus, tabbouleh salad and baklava -- to Marines who'd been stationed in Iraq and the Persian Gulf.      Swaintek, while lauding the indigenous cuisine, also cried foul about fatty U.S. fast foods, saying that \"overweight soldiers are a problem.\"      Army Sgt. Paul Williams, who is serving in Iraq, agrees with the captain but indulges in \"the occasional pizza from Pizza Hut, burrito from Taco Bell, or maybe even a sandwich from Subway,\" citing the virtue of being able to enjoy a pizza in the middle of the desert and escape for a few minutes to talk with fellow soldiers about their homes, sweethearts or future plans.      Ultimately, though, the military is a culture of intense physical fitness, and access to nutritious meals at mess halls helps servicemen and women maintain their physical and psychological. edge. And Williams says that \"a soldier has a responsibility to maintain himself.\"      While deployed troops can certainly take the reins of their physical health, friends and family stateside can still boost morale and offer a taste of home with much-appreciated care packages. The Department of Defense maintains a list of links to groups coordinating care packages for overseas soldiers.      According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, most foods that are tightly prepackaged and immune to mold or bacterial growth are safe for sending to soldiers. They recommend dried proteins, like beef and turkey jerky, as well as dehydrated soups, dried fruits and even dense baked goods like fruitcakes.      Just make sure to seal it all up with a kiss."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/1fe89a8e5acfe9855a02b5c6dcf0bf9c1e7369e4.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was the selling price for a tech startup in April?", "id": "107801", "answers": [{"text": "seven figures", "answer_start": 116}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNET) -- Suleman Ali cashed out just in time.  Suleman Ali sold Esgut, his portfolio of Facebook applications, for seven figures in April.  The 26-year-old, a former Microsoft employee who helped put together the Windows Home Server product, founded a company called Esgut within months of the debut of Facebook's developer platform in May 2007. Esgut is a portfolio of Facebook applications, and a few of them, like Superlatives and Entourage, became genuine viral hits.  In April, Ali sold the 12-employee Esgut to the Social Gaming Network, a Silicon Valley company backed by the likes of Bezos Expeditions, the Founders Fund, and Greylock Partners. He said the price was in the seven figures.  But Ali is the first to acknowledge that for upstart social-platform developers, hailed just months ago as the Valley's hottest breed of bright young things, the condition has taken a significant turn for the worse.  \"Most people are not counting on anything,\" the lanky and bespectacled Ali said over lunch at an organic restaurant near New York's Union Square in early December. \"They're just operating from day to day.\"  When Facebook's developer platform launched, the social network's traffic began to really skyrocket. What had started as a no-frills networking site for students at elite universities became a Silicon Valley buzz factory with legitimate geek credentials. And however gimmicky many of the most popular Facebook Platform apps were, millions of people decided they now had a reason to join the site. The floodgates had opened. Facebook was a phenomenon.  When other social networks such as MySpace, Friendster, and Hi5 also paraded out developer platforms, the tech world took it as evidence that there was a big future in building platform applications. More importantly for developers and ambitious tech entrepreneurs, it looked like there could be gobs of money in it; the open, anyone-can-play attitude created the notion that there was enough for everyone.  \"The social platform (on Facebook) actually launched the last day that I was at Microsoft...I was quitting without any idea of what I was going to do,\" Ali recalled. His aims for leaving Redmond were starry-eyed. \"I left because I wanted to do a start-up. I wanted to see what I could do out there on my own. And I wanted to care deeply about what I was working on.\"  But he had no concrete plans to go the Facebook route initially, he said. \"I ended up in my parents' house in Florida and was kind of bored, and started building Facebook apps just out of restlessness and the desire to do something.\"  Then, Ali continued, he went to the Graphing Social Patterns West conference in San Diego in March and met Social Gaming Network founder Shervin Pishevar. At the time, he was looking to raise venture funding but hadn't thought about selling his apps. \"We talked for 30 minutes and he was like, 'You sound like the exact type of people we want at SGN.'\"  Ali sold Esgut to Pishevar's company the next month.  Widgets buzz turns into hush  Ali got lucky. Even before the reality of the recession set in, the social-platform craze was subsiding. The venture capital buzz about widgets began to quiet over the summer. Some of the sillier novelty apps wore off in popularity. Companies that were snapping up small apps and raising huge amounts of venture capital, like Slide and RockYou, grew intimidatingly bigger--but the glut of independent apps made it more difficult to grab the attention of potential buyers.  And after new restrictions, a redesign, and then the social network's focus on expanding through its Facebook Connect log-in service, it became evident that a social-network platform is still a new phenomenon that can change dramatically, and not always to the benefit of little start-ups.  \"There's definitely a lot of tightening up,\" Ali said. \"There's a few people that I know that have apps that are relatively small, and they're selling them for valuations lower than what they could've sold them for a month ago, and there are just no buyers in the marketplace. I think they're going to have a hard time selling, period--forget trying to sell at a lower valuation. They're just having a hard time getting rid of them.\"  So would he still be able to sell his company as easily now? \"No, probably not,\" Ali admitted. \"If we were the same company we were then, it would be much harder to sell today. I think we would've had to evolve as a company. I think we would need to be generating more revenue than we were.\"  But for all his concern about the fate of social-platform developers in a recession, Ali is still strikingly bullish on Facebook--enough so that his newest project is a fund for Facebook stock. He started purchasing it in November, he said, and is meeting with investors in the hopes of purchasing more. He added with surprising gusto that Facebook's decision to delay direct cash-outs hasn't derailed his plan.  \"I think that's actually good news for us,\" Ali said. \"I think that means that the price that we pay will actually go down because there are all these employees who intended to sell stock back to Facebook, and now they're not going to be able to sell it to Facebook, (so) they'll have to sell it somewhere else.\"  He hopes to keep the stock until Facebook files for an initial public offering, and he still thinks that's on track, too. \"I think it's going to be a function of the economy and when the markets open back up for an IPO,\" he said, and cited target dates that had been provided in interviews by Facebook investor and board member Jim Breyer. \"From a Facebook perspective, I think it'll be ready to IPO in 2011.\"  Many critics would say that's wishful thinking, and that the company will sell--to existing investor Microsoft, maybe--for much lower than its $15 billion preferred-stock valuation.  But Ali got lucky on Facebook once already, and even in a recession he hasn't given up hope that it could happen again.  \u00c2\u00a9 2008 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

At least 540 people were wounded in Sunday's attacks, the deadliest in the capital in more than two years, the ministry said.    One of the bombs exploded outside Baghdad's governorate building, the other outside the Justice Ministry. The bombs detonated in quick succession about 10:30 a.m., officials said.    The children were packed in a mini bus that was outside the Justice Ministry building, a ministry official said.    The vehicle carrying the explosives that detonated outside the ministry building was a stolen white pick-up from Falluja, Baghdad Gov. Salah Abdul Razzaq told CNN during his inspection of the bomb site. Images from the time of the attack showed the truck, linked to the Department of Water, pull up to the side of the building and blow up, he said.    Plumes of smoke billowed from the sites as victims fled, some with blood streaming down their faces. The streets were strewn with debris, including charred cars and chunks of concrete. Some government buildings and others in the area were heavily damaged.    Among the wounded were three American security contractors, the U.S. Embassy said, declining to provide further details. The area struck is close to the heavily guarded \"Green Zone,\" which houses the embassy.    The blasts sparked questions about Iraq's security and national elections planned for January.    Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who visited the scene shortly after the explosions, said holding the elections as scheduled would send a strong message to the attackers.    \"The cowardly attack ... should not affect the determination of the Iraqi people from continuing their battle against the deposed regime and the gangs of criminal Baath party, and the terrorist al Qaeda organization,'\" al-Maliki said in a written statement.    U.S. President Barack Obama called the attacks an attempt to derail progress in Iraq, and pledged to work closely with the country as it prepares for elections. Obama spoke with the prime minister and President Jalal Talabani to express his condolences and reiterate U.S. support.    In August, more than 100 people were killed in a series of bombings that led to tightened security in Baghdad. Blast walls were installed across the city and checkpoints were added.    Two years earlier, three truck bombings killed hundreds in Qahtaniya, in northern Iraq. Sunday's attacks were the deadliest on Iraqi civilians since those blasts in August 2007.    A day before Sunday's explosions, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, visited Iraq for the first time. During her trip, she made a condolence stop at the Foreign Ministry, one of six sites attacked in August.    Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls January 16, but parliament has not passed key election legislation, putting the balloting in limbo.    The president, prime minister and other top officials are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the elections law and security concerns.

Hamas supporters stand on the rubble of a building hit by an Israeli strike that killed Hamas' interior minister.  According to Amnesty International, at least 24 Palestinian men -- most of them civilians -- were shot and killed by Hamas gunmen during the recent Israeli offensive aimed at crippling the Hamas leadership in Gaza.  \"Scores of others have been shot in the legs, kneecapped or inflicted with other injuries intended to cause permanent disability,\" the human rights organization said in a news release.  Hamas leaders have publicly accused followers of its rival Palestinian political faction, Fatah, of spying for the Israelis during the conflict, and they have said many have been arrested for collaborating with the Jewish state. But they deny ordering any reprisal attacks against suspected spies, instead blaming rogue elements.  The Israeli military offensive in Gaza was launched at the end of December and ended three weeks later, when Israeli forces withdrew under the terms of a cease-fire agreement.  Amnesty said that the targets of \"Hamas' deadly campaign\" include prisoners who escaped from Gaza's central prison when Israeli forces bombed it in the initial days of the military conflict.  Some prisoners injured in the Israeli bombing were \"shot dead in the hospitals where they were receiving treatment,\" Amnesty said.  \"The perpetrators of these attacks did not conceal their weapons or keep a low profile, but, on the contrary, behaved in a carefree and confident -- almost ostentatious -- manner,\" it said.  Other targets included former members of Palestinian Authority security forces and supporters of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party.  Fatah, which is based in the West Bank, has denied spying on Hamas. Fatah leaders have accused Hamas of rounding up at least 175 of their members in Gaza during the Israeli war and torturing them.  The two Palestinian factions have been locked in a power struggle since Hamas won parliamentary elections in January 2006 and wrested Gaza from Fatah in violent clashes the following year. Abbas is a U.S. ally and regularly negotiates with Israel as the Palestinian leader, but he holds little sway in Gaza.  Fatah supporters have been accused of helping the Israeli military conduct its campaign in Gaza, which targeted the Hamas leadership. Neighbors of Hamas Interior Minister Said Siam said they suspected Fatah supporters helped Israel pinpoint his location when they bombed his house on January 15.  Siam was highest-ranking Hamas member killed in the Israeli offensive.  Most of those suspected of spying for Israel have been abducted from their homes and then \"dumped -- dead or injured -- in isolated areas,\" according to Amnesty International.  During the Gaza conflict, medical officials at Gaza City's main medical facility, Shifa Hospital, said injuries they witnessed were consistent with people being shot in the kneecaps, elbows, hands or feet.  Punishment shootings are a time-tested tactic used worldwide by guerrilla and militia groups, from Che Guevara in Cuba to the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. They are meant not only to take revenge but also to send a message to others.  Two self-described Fatah loyalists were found heavily bandaged at a Gaza City safe house during the recent conflict. One of their colleagues refused to say where or why they were injured, but they denied spying.  \"They shot him at close range with a pistol,\" he said of one man. \"His bones are shattered. They shot him point-blank in the foot. ... This was done by Hamas people.\"  The other man, he said, was struck on his legs with a metal construction bar. \"Four people were beating him,\" he said.  A Hamas security source told CNN the shootings occurred because renegade gunmen took the law into their own hands. Ehad al-Ghossain, Hamas' Interior Ministry spokesman, said there was no official order within Hamas to carry out such shootings.  \"That's not us,\" al-Ghossain said. \"Maybe some families who had problems in the past just wanted to shoot these people.\"  CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this report"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/e15cb0bb735636482faf8678e2a13311f0eab3eb.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what did lopez say", "id": "107808", "answers": [{"text": "\"It's a business.

Genetic screening allows lab-fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems.  Her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the BRCA-1 gene, linked to breast and ovarian cancer.  People with the gene are known to have a 50-80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetimes.  British newspapers have dubbed the girl the \"cancer-free\" baby.  \"This little girl will not face the specter of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life,\" said Paul Serhal, a consultant at University College London Hospital and Medical Director of the Assisted Conception Unit.  \"The parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter.

What do you think about testing embryos for gene defects?  \"This is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody (prone to) the disease,\" she said. \"It is basically a search-and-kill mechanism.\"  She opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease-causing genes often are discarded. She says that is essentially murder.  \"They will be destroyed,\" she said. \"They will never be allowed to live.\"  Doctors in Britain and elsewhere increasingly test embryos for genes that are certain to cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's Disease.  What's different about the girl born Friday is that she is the first infant known to have been tested in Britain as an embryo for a gene that is merely likely -- not certain -- to cause disease.  In the United States, geneticists are free to test for any condition for which they can develop a probe -- and they're free to look for genes that are certain to cause diseases as well as genes that merely may pose problems later in life.  Quintavalle opposes any form of in-vitro fertilization where embryos are \"killed,\" she said. But she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the BRCA-1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease, and the disease is not always fatal.  \"The message we are sending is: 'Better off dead than carrying (a gene linked to) breast cancer,'\" she said. \"We have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope.\"  Peter Braude, one of the top British experts on the genetic testing of embryos, said he understands the ethical objections but focuses on the benefits.  \"There has always been a vociferous group in opposition,\" he said. But \"there are people who can benefit and I think they should be allowed to do so.\"  In fact, he argues that the procedure actually prevents abortions because it takes place on a three-day old embryo in a lab. Only embryos that lack the defective gene are implanted.  \"I don't think you can equate eight cells in a dish to an embryo or a child,\" said Braude, head of the department of women's health at the King's College London School of Medicine.  For many couples, the alternative to testing an embryo is to conceive a child naturally and test the fetus weeks or months into a pregnancy. Some couples opt for an abortion when such testing reveals a defect.  Diagnosing an embryo genetically typically involves fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab, testing the resulting embryo and implanting it in the mother if no defects are found.  Braude agrees that testing for diseases that may not be fatal -- or may not manifest themselves for decades -- raises thorny ethical questions.  \"How serious does it have to be before you throw away an embryo?\" he asked. \"Are you prepared to throw away a 16-week embryo for Huntington's, which will not manifest until age 40?\"  In Britain, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority determines the conditions for which geneticists can test. It has approved testing for more than 60 conditions since it was established in 1990.  The authority approved testing for the BRCA-1 gene in 2008.  Dr. Mark Hughes, who founded a genetics clinic in the United States, said he likes the idea of an authority that regulates what tests can be performed -- the system in place in Britain -- but believes that parents who want to test for genetic abnormalities should be allowed to do so.  At his Genesis Genetics Institute in Detroit, Michigan, Hughes carries out about two tests a month for BRCA-1 or BRCA-2, a related gene.  \"The couple is the best one to be making these decisions, because they live with these diseases,\" he said.  \"When it hits your family over and over again, many couples are saying: 'Enough of this. Let's prune this out of our family tree forever.'\"  He rejects the notion that parents will use genetic testing to remove all imperfections from children.  \"You can get up on your high horse and say people are looking for perfect children, but let's give these families more credit,\" he said. \"They just want one that has a fighting chance of not having a disease.\"  Hughes said he doubts genetic screening will ever be used to test all babies. That's partly because it costs the equivalent of about $11,755 -- 8,000 British pounds -- to screen embryos.  It's also because the process is very complex.  \"It's gotten easier to do now than it was 19 years ago,\" when Hughes did his first test for cystic fibrosis, he said. \"But it has not exploded, not burst onto the medical field like some technologies do.  \"No one would use these technologies for a trivial reason. It's too much effort,\" he said. \"Not just the money -- it's so many hoops to jump through for a couple that would prefer to make their baby on vacation rather than in a clinic.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/d4aa7135471c82bf38771e33a4e9cd1726272b3b.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What were the two charged with?", "id": "107812", "answers": [{"text": "providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim", "answer_start": 388}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN)  -- A federal grand jury has indicted two Minnesota men in connection with the recruitment of Somali immigrants to fight with Islamic insurgents in their home country.    Jamal Bana is one of several missing Somali-Americans believed to have fought with an Islamist insurgency.    Salah Osman Ahmed and Abdifatah Yusuf Isse are charged with one count each of providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure people overseas, the indictment states. The recruiting effort took place between September 2007 and December 2008, according to the charges.    Ahmed also is charged with two counts of making false statements to investigators. According to the indictment, he told FBI agents that he had traveled alone on a flight to Somalia when, in fact, he and another person were going together \"so that they could fight jihad in Somalia.\"    Ahmed was arrested Saturday, FBI Special Agent E.K. Wilson told CNN. Isse had been in custody for some time, said Omar Jamal, the head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis. Both were from Minnesota and in their 20s, Jamal said.    Jamal said Ahmed and Isse were \"foot soldiers\" carrying out the work of others, and that he expected more indictments \"in a week or two.\"    The FBI has been investigating what appears to be a massive recruiting effort by the al Qaeda-linked Somali insurgent group al-Shabaab in immigrant communities in the United States. More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis area in recent months, and at least three have been killed in Somalia, community leaders have said.    The latest, Jamal Bana, was confirmed dead over the weekend, his family said Sunday. The same day, Somalia's president -- a former member of the Islamist movement himself -- issued a plea to Somali-Americans not to join the fight in his country.    \"I am saying to those young men from abroad: 'Your families fled your home to America because of insecurity. You should not return here to foment violence against your people,' \" President Sheik Sharif Ahmed said.    Al-Shabaab has ties to al Qaeda and has recruited foreign fighters to join its battle to overthrow the Somali government, U.S. officials said.    It remains entrenched in the northeast and in sections south of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, after fighting that has uprooted more than 200,000 people since early May, according to the United Nations.    Wilson said the number of missing men believed to be in Somalia is \"in the 10s,\" but their recruitment is \"a significant concern and one that we're giving our highest priority.\"    In October, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, a Somali-American believed to have been radicalized by al-Shabaab, traveled from Minneapolis to Somalia and blew up himself and 29 others. It was the first suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen, and it raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community and sparked an investigation by the FBI.    Burhan Hassan, a 17-year-old Somali-American high school student in Minneapolis, went missing eight months ago, around the same time as Bana. Last month, his family learned that he was killed in Somalia.    Neither family has any idea why the young males left the United States, where they came as young boys, and Bana's family believes he was being held against his will, said Omar Jamal, head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis.    \"Only one time he placed a phone call [in mid-November], he didn't say much,\" Jamal said. \"He spoke as if he was being held hostage. He couldn't be speak freely. They asked him to cut the conversation short.\"    Hassan's uncle, Abdirizak Bihi, said a fourth man -- 30-year-old Zakariya Maruf -- was killed Friday, but Jamal said Maruf may only be injured.    Maruf was the first of the missing Somalis to head overseas, said Bihi, who has become a spokesman for the families of the missing men. Bihi called him a \"leader\" whom the others consulted on travel plans.    Many of the missing Somali-Americans are believed to have left for Somalia when Ethiopian forces were still on the ground. Ethiopia invaded Somalia to push the Islamists out of Mogadishu in December 2006, but their presence in the country was an outrage to most Somalis and became a rallying cry for al-Shabaab.    Ethiopian troops left Somalia this year, leaving Ahmed's weak transitional government to battle the insurgents.

The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds.    Introduced by a publicist and beside a man who promoted what turned out to be a fake Bigfoot discovery in 1995, Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer repeatedly said that their claim is not a hoax and that scientific analysis will prove it.    \"We were not looking for Bigfoot. ... We wouldn't know what we were doing if we did,\" said Whitton, a police officer on leave after being shot in the hand while making an arrest. \"I didn't believe in Bigfoot at the time. ... But you've got to come to terms with it and realize you've got something special. And that's what it was.\"    The men say they were hiking in early June when they discovered the body of a 7-foot-7, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature near a stream. They also claim to have spotted about three similar living creatures -- and showed reporters video stills of what they say is one of those creatures shadowing them through the woods.  Watch report of scientist skeptical of Bigfoot claim \u00bb    The announcement, which the men first made on the Internet radio show \"Squatch Detective\" several weeks ago, has been greeted with healthy skepticism, even among some Bigfoot enthusiasts.    Scientists, including the head of North Georgia College and State University's biology department, have said it's unlikely a tribe of 7-foot-tall creatures would have avoided discovery in a region popular among hikers, hunters and vacationers.    Several Web sites have popped up questioning the claim and comparing a photo that the men say is the creature's body inside a freezer to a widely available Bigfoot costume.    On Friday, Whitton acknowledged creating a pair of videos posted on the Internet video site YouTube, one in which his brother poses as a scientist and another in which Whitton briefly seems to admit that the body is a fake.    \"It seems that the stalkers have busted us in a hoax,\" he says in the video. But then adds, \"we still have a corpse. We just wanted to give you something to do for the weekend.\"    At Friday's news conference, Whitton first said that no video existed in which he calls the discovery a hoax.    But after speaking to Tom Biscardi, the self-described \"Real Bigfoot Hunter\" who has been searching for the creature of legend since 1971, he said the video was made \"to have a little fun with it\" and was originally intended to throw off the \"psychos\" who had stalked him and his family since the men first made their claim. iReport.com: Have you seen 'Bigfoot'?    The two also promoted a Web site registered to Whitton on June 16 and said they plan to write a book about their experience.    Friday's news conference was held in Palo Alto, California, near the home of Biscardi. About 100 reporters and onlookers attended the event, in a hotel banquet room, including a man who shouted questions while wearing a gorilla suit.    Dyer and Whitton said they were carrying a video camera during their hike to film wildlife.    They said they handed the body over to Biscardi, who is keeping it at an undisclosed location until a team of scientists can examine it.    One of the two photographs the men gave to reporters Friday showed what appears to be the creature's mouth, an effort to disprove allegations that what's in the photo is a costume.    \"I want to get to the bottom of it,\" Biscardi said. \"I'll tell you what I've seen and what I've touched and what I've felt, what I've prodded was not a mask sewed onto a bear hide, OK?\"    Biscardi acknowledged that he promoted a fake Bigfoot discovery in 1995, saying the woman who claimed to have the body convinced his staff members before he visited her and discovered that she was mentally ill.    Alleged Bigfoot sightings have surfaced from time to time for years, dating to at least the 1800s. The most famous was the so-called Patterson film from 1967, which is purported to show a tall, furry, apelike creature walking along, at one point looking over its shoulder at the videographer.    Most scientists who have studied the film say there's no way to authenticate it, and many say the creature appears to be a man in a costume.

The Drug Enforcement Administration said Wednesday it's considering tighter restrictions on propofol.    \"We were petitioned and have been been looking into it for the past two years,\" said DEA spokesman Rusty Payne, who added in response to a question that the inquiry had not been affected by the singer's death of cardiac arrest on June 25.    The agency is looking at designating the sedative as a \"scheduled\" drug, which would tighten restrictions on the its distribution and use.    Payne said he could not divulge anything related to the Jackson investigation, \"but I can tell you that researchers making the decision about propofol would typically be interested in any information that would help them answer questions about the effects of propofol and its potential harm to the user.\"    Propofol, known by the trade name of Diprivan, is administered intravenously in operating rooms as a powerful anesthetic and sedative.    Payne said concern about the drug's potential for abuse led to the petition. But, he added, \"as far as we know, this is not something that's been highly abused.\"    Payne said he did not know who had sought the change, adding, \"Typically we would not make that public.\"    The process required to get a drug scheduled is a lengthy one, involving a number of agencies, he said.    \"Lots of experts weigh in on questions such as potential for abuse, pharmacological effects, history and current patterns abuse,\" he said.    Nutritionist Cherilyn Lee has said Jackson pleaded for the drug as a sleep aid, despite being told of its potentially harmful effects.    And sources close to Jackson told CNN that the insomniac singer traveled with an anesthesiologist who would \"take him down\" at night and \"bring him back up\" during a world tour in the mid-1990s.    The Associated Press and The Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified sources, have reported that police found Diprivan among Jackson's medicines.    Officials have said that the exact cause of death and whether drug use may have been involved will not be determined until after toxicology tests are completed, which could be several weeks.    On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory, saying two lots of a generic version of the drug had tested positive for endotoxin, a contaminant. The drug maker, Teva Pharmaceuticals, voluntarily recalled the lots. No fatalities were reported.    A Teva spokeswoman said the DEA had contacted the drug maker \"about a specific lot number, and that lot number is not from the two we are recalling.\"    Spokeswoman Denise Bradley would not say whether the contact was related to the Jackson investigation.    A DEA spokesman said he could not comment on any ongoing investigation.    In a written statement issued this month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists said it \"unequivocally maintains that Diprivan, or its generic name propofol, is a drug meant only for use in a medical setting by professionals trained in the provision of general anesthesia.    \"Though the drug is often used for procedures requiring sedation, patients can have extremely variable responses to the drug and some patients can become completely anesthetized, including losing the ability to breathe,\" the statement continued.    \"Diprivan should never be used outside of a controlled and monitored medical setting. Use of the drug should be directly supervised by a physician trained in anesthesia and qualified to provide physiologic rescue should too much drug be given,\" the statement said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/8918ac803c70e8610df6b712d9110f6b3bed34bd.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what happened to the gas grill", "id": "107818", "answers": [{"text": "a line to the propane tank on the brother's", "answer_start": 5165}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Democratic congressional leaders Wednesday demanded Republicans join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed Sunday's vote on a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. health care system.      More than 10 Democrats have reported trouble since the weekend vote, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters. Windows have been smashed at Democratic offices in at least three states, and federal agents were investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a Virginia congressman's brother was related to the lawmaker's yes vote.      Democracy \"is not about violence,\" Hoyer said at a news conference with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House of Representatives.      \"Both of us believe that to remain silent in the face of such activity gives the impression of either condoning or sanctioning such actions,\" added Hoyer, D-Maryland.      The top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner, told reporters that he has urged opponents to demonstrate legally.      \"I've made statements that I understand people are angry, but violence and threats are inappropriate and irresponsible,\" the Ohio congressman said. \"If people are angry, they ought to register to vote and get involved in a campaign.\"      The white-hot rhetoric that dominated the last several months of debate on the historic health care bill culminated in unruly protests by the Tea Party movement at the Capitol over the weekend. Three African-American House Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, reported protesters shouted racial slurs at them and spit at one of them, while Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, an openly gay House member, had anti-gay slurs yelled at him.      One House member mentioned a map on the Facebook page of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during a Wednesday meeting on safety concerns, a Democratic source said.      The map shows 20 House Democratic political targets believed to be vulnerable in the upcoming midterm elections -- some have already announced their retirements. Their home districts are marked with cross hairs. Mention of the map brought audible groans to the room, the source said.      Republican House members encouraged protesters outside and inside the House gallery, some of whom carried messages like \"Vote no or else\" or \"If Brown won't stop it, a Browning will\" -- a reference to newly elected Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol.      Since the vote, an Alabama blogger has launched a \"window war\" against Democrats and has kept a tally of the recent incidents of damage, including ones in upstate New York, Arizona and Kansas. A message left for Michigan Democrat Bart Stupak, whose last-minute decision to support the bill helped give Democrats the votes it needed to pass, warned that \"there are millions of people across the country who wish you ill, and all of those thoughts projected on you will materialize into something that's not very good for you.\"      Clyburn, who is African-American, said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home.      iReport: 'A very dangerous time for Obama'      \"We're giving aid and comfort to these people, and this stuff gets ratcheted up,\" Clyburn told CNN. \"We in this Congress have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down. It doesn't make sense. That's not what a democracy is all about.\"      Hoyer told a news conference that \"a significant number, meaning over 10\" lawmakers had reported either threats, vandalism or other incidents. Capitol police officials have briefed House Democrats on reporting suspicious or threatening activity and taking precautions to avoid \"subjecting themselves or their families to physical harm,\" he said.      Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, said her Niagara Falls district office had a brick thrown through one of its windows and a message that referred to \"snipers\" was left on one of her campaign offices. In a written statement, she said GOP leaders have been \"fanning the flames with coded rhetoric.\" And Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen blamed Republicans for encouraging heated rhetoric over the bill.      \"There's a real feeling that some of the comments from the Republican leaders and Republicans are not tamping down the fire, they are throwing fuel on the fire. And that is totally inappropriate,\" Van Hollen said.      But Boehner, who compared the legislation's passage to \"Armageddon,\" said Democrats had not complained to him that Republicans haven't been quick enough to condemn the threats and vandalism.      Clyburn said his wife has forwarded the phone numbers from the calls to law enforcement agencies. Slaughter said federal agents and local authorities were investigating the threat and vandalism at her offices. And in Virginia, Albemarle County fire marshals and the FBI are looking into the slashing of a propane gas line outside the home of Rep. Tom Perriello's brother, the congressman's office said.      A Perriello aide told CNN that a line to the propane tank on the brother's gas grill had been severed after the brother's home address was posted online by a Tea Party activist. Lee Catlin, a spokesman for the fire marshal's office, said the incident \"did not involve an immediate threat to occupants of the residence\" but would disclose no details.      The county joined the investigation late Tuesday after a request from the FBI, Caitlin said.      \"Officials are taking the incident very seriously and conducting a vigorous investigation,\" he said.      Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck told his radio audience Monday that Democrats who supported the bill would be remembered as \"an enemy of the republic\" and \"an enemy to the Constitution.\" But he urged viewers of his Fox News television show Wednesday to avoid violence, because \"radical\" supporters of the Obama administration are counting on such attacks to discredit their opposition, he said.      \"Not only is it completely nuts and wrong, it's exactly what they want,\" Beck said. He told viewers, \"They are begging for it. You are being set up.\"      But in Kansas, Democrats in Wichita are seeking to raise money over a brick thrown through the window of the party headquarters.      \"At first, we thought our office was just the object of a random act of bitter violence, but now we know that's not the case,\" said the Sedgewick County Democratic Party's Web site. \"This attack was instigated, encouraged and directed by an ultra-right wing blogger and similar events occurred all over the country.\"      The Web site item asked for donations to \"help us get back to work.\"      CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Dana Bash, Lesa Jansen and Tom Cohen contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9529cd4b1ec6651bb839c083f627b9bd4c18e089.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was the mom battling?", "id": "107825", "answers": [{"text": "the swine flu virus,", "answer_start": 71}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- An infant girl delivered prematurely from her mother, who has the swine flu virus, has died, hospital officials said Monday.

Palm Beach County has had 247 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus, known as swine flu, but only one death. In late June, a 25-year-old pregnant woman died, but her baby survived.    Pregnant women have long been a prime concern of health care officials regarding the flu virus, but are of particular concern during this outbreak of swine flu. Pregnant women have always been advised to get a flu shot because they are at greater risk because of the weakened immune system resulting from their pregnancy. But the H1N1 epidemic has seen new complications and challenges.    \"We have seen, with this virus, worse complications and severe infections in pregnant women,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"We're urging women who are pregnant who develop fever or respiratory symptoms to seek care promptly.\"    The CDC said it is vitally important for pregnant women to recognize the signs and symptoms, like fever and cough, to get to their doctor quickly and to begin taking antiviral medicines early on.    \"I know that many pregnant women don't want to take anything while they're pregnant,\" said Schuchat. \"This is a situation where you need to be more worried about your health and the baby's health.\"    The CDC also recommends that pregnant women get the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available, in addition to an annual flu shot. \"For people who are at high risk, like pregnant women, planning to receive both vaccines is probably the right way to go,\" Schuchat said.    The CDC's advisory committee will meet later this month to make recommendations on at-risk groups who should receive the new vaccine."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/75a898dfd0d1999e6b51c2f30d86ab0745bef182.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many children does autism and related disorders affect?", "id": "107828", "answers": [{"text": "about one out of every 150 babies born each year.", "answer_start": 2818}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Editor's note: You can follow the Bilsons' progress on CNN American Morning 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. through February 4.    Mary Bilson tries to contain her autistic daughter Marissa's tantrum, as Marissa's brother Brendan looks on.    Seal Beach, CALIFORNIA (CNN) -- The Bilson family is like many other families: three kids, a cat, and a small, lovely home with lots of family photos and carved wooden wall signs with sayings like \"Live, Laugh, Love.\"    But step inside their house after 4 p.m. most weekdays and you'll want to cover your ears because of the noise -- the screaming, to be exact. These are not the shouts of sibling rivalry or parental annoyance. This is the high-pitched, ear-shattering sound of a 13-year-old girl. More accurately, it is the sound of a frustrated, irritated, very loud teenager with autism.    Marissa, the middle Bilson child, was diagnosed with autism when she was a toddler. Her mother, Mary, a nurse, knew something wasn't right early on, when young Marissa's tantrums were off the charts and seemingly unwarranted.    But during the first few years, doctors told Mary Bilson that her daughter was fine and this behavior would eventually pass. They were wrong on both counts.    Marissa's behavior has not passed; it has, in fact, become worse. According to Bilson, Marissa and her tantrums rule the household. \"I don't want to hear her screaming and tantruming, so we pretty much let her do what she wants,\" Bilson says. \"We\" means Mary, her husband, John, and their two other children, Brittany, 15, and 6-year-old Brendan.    Keeping the peace means that, when it comes to Marissa, the rules are different. She is allowed unlimited time on the one family computer. She is allowed access to her siblings' rooms and possessions. She is allowed to eat dinner at the computer instead of the family table.  Watch part one of the Bilsons' journey \u00bb    But before you sit in judgment of the Bilsons, and suggest they just need a firm hand to keep their middle child in line, consider one thing: They are trying to cope with a child with severely impaired social sensibilities.    \"Do you think people who don't have children with autism know how tough it is to deal with them?\" CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, asked Marissa's mom in a recent interview.    \"No,\" Mary Bilson replied. \"And I don't see how they could.\"    She's right -- we can't, because many of us have never seen autism in action, day in and day out.  Learn more about autism \u00bb    Autism is described on the National Institutes of Health Web site as a \"developmental disorder that appears in the first three years of life, and affects the brain's normal development of social and communication skills.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, autism and related disorders affect about one out of every 150 babies born each year.    Autism manifests itself in many different ways. Although there are some common threads, like language issues, repetitive movements and difficulties connecting to others, specific behavioral patterns are largely unique to the individual. \"Children with autism are all different; they are like snowflakes,\" explains Dr. Ronald Leaf, co-director of the group Autism Partnership.    The one thing that Leaf believes they all have in common is that \"they are not expected to do enough.\" Leaf insists we have set the bar too low for what we think children and adults with autism can do. \"They are highly teachable,\" he says. \"You just have to have a good teacher.\"    A good teacher is exactly what Bilson was looking for to help her with Marissa. The family had already tried various programs, starting when Marissa was a toddler -- but nothing completely worked for her. And as Marissa entered her teen years, her behavior grew worse. Mary knew that her daughter needed to be reined in, and it needed to be done now.    \"She is getting older. She's 13 and her tantrums are louder and longer than they used to be. It's just so inappropriate. It was OK when she was much younger, but now that she's going to be an adult soon, she can't be behaving this way,\" Bilson says with tired resignation.    But what could the Bilsons do? This family doesn't have a lot of extra money, and most programs either aren't covered by insurance or have long waiting lists. The costs are staggering, according to the Web site FightingAutism.org. Families with autistic children can expect to spend $30,000 annually to provide proper medical, educational and other assistance necessary for dealing with an autistic child.  Watch part two of the Bilsons' journey \u00bb    Enter Autism Partnership, or AP. This group, founded in 1994, offers extensive therapeutic services to children and adults with the disorder. One of its most unique programs is an intensive one-on-one, at-home intervention service that is similar in scope to what happens on the television show \"Nanny 911.\" It's not cheap -- about $2,500 per day, typically for a five-day period (with additional days on an \"as needed\" basis).    Most of AP's work is grounded in a behavior modification technique known as Applied Behavioral Analysis or ABA. Essentially, the method breaks down behavior patterns, rewarding proper behavior while being careful not to encourage improper responses.    And that is exactly how AP therapist Rick Schroeder hopes to reshape Marissa Bilson's worst behavior. The group, which met Marissa while working in her school, offered the Bilson family a free week-long intervention with the proviso that CNN be allowed to record the process.    The week started off with a day of observation -- a day with lots and lots of screaming and tantrums, that left Schroeder stunned.  He had observed Marissa at school where, he says, she was much less demonstrative.    But Schroeder is still eager and ready to tackle the challenge.    \"I think the family is starting to realize something needs to change, and that's very good,\" he says after his day of observation. \"As far as Marissa's behavior goes -- and the level that she is capable of going to -- she's pretty much out of control, for sure.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/97223b7119e264a598afe67e0ba82fbb97fedd2b.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How much was being extorted from the victim?", "id": "107833", "answers": [{"text": "$25 million", "answer_start": 421}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "NASSAU, Bahamas (CNN) -- John Travolta's lawyer testified Tuesday that the paramedic who drove Travolta's son to a hospital the day he died later wanted money for documents the driver suggested could be detrimental to the actor.    John Travolta's son died of a seizure in January at the age of 16.    Paramedic Tarino Lightbourne and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial, accused of plotting to extort $25 million from Travolta after 16-year-old Jett Travolta died from a seizure in the Bahamas.    Travolta, who testified last Wednesday, is expected to return to the witness stand later in the week.    Travolta's lawyer, Allyson Maynard-Gibson, said Bridgewater approached her in the days after Jett's death on January 2, saying she had a client who had a document Travolta might want.    Bridgewater gave her copies of the papers, which included ambulance dispatch reports and a paper signed by Travolta releasing the ambulance company from legal liability, Maynard-Gibson testified.    The paramedic expected Travolta would pay millions to prevent publication of the documents because \"he would not want his name tarnished in media,\" Maynard-Gibson said.    Bridgewater told Travolta's lawyer that her client believed the documents could suggest that Travolta was negligent by wanting to take his son to his private jet for a flight to a Florida hospital, instead of going directly to a local hospital, she said.    Maynard-Gibson said she called police, who then videotaped a hotel room meeting between the paramedic and another Travolta lawyer. Those investigators testified Tuesday, and their video was expected to be played in court later.    Travolta's testimony last week was the first time he spoke publicly about his desperate efforts to save his son's life after he suffered a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas.    Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, have been in seclusion for most of this year. Friends have described their deep grief over Jett's death.    Travolta said a nanny found Jett unresponsive at the home on the island of Grand Bahamas, where the family was spending their New Year's holiday.    A family friend with a medical background helped in urgent efforts to revive Jett, Travolta said.    \"We continued CPR, and my wife was holding his head,\" Travolta said. His wife sat in the Nassau courtroom, sometimes crying as she listened to the testimony.    Travolta said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked. Travolta, who is a pilot, said he wanted to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in Freeport.    The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability.    \"I received a liability of release document,\" he said. \"I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence.\"    Travolta said that while he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to divert to the hospital.    At the hospital, Travolta was told his son \"wasn't alive,\" he said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/66b2dca4301457e1a240bf537de8503f6e111614.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was the genre of rap that the performer worked in?", "id": "107835", "answers": [{"text": "\"Horrorcore\"", "answer_start": 531}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Elizabeth McCutchen and a friend were walking to book club two weeks ago in quaint Farmville, Virginia, when they strolled by a home on First Avenue.    \"Something smells dead,\" her friend said.    They were thinking animal. A dog, a cat, something like that. They never imagined they were smelling the remains of massacred humans. It was Thursday, September 17. But another 24 hours would pass before police made the gruesome discovery.    Richard Samuel McCroskey III -- a 20-year-old rapper in the underground genre of \"Horrorcore\" who sang of chopping people into pieces -- has been arrested in connection with the slayings. The crime scene was so horrifying police would not even describe it, saying only that the victims died of blunt force trauma.    The victims were Mark Niederbrock, 50, the beloved pastor at Walker's Presbyterian Church; his 16-year-old daughter, Emma Niederbrock; Melanie Wells, Emma's 18-year-old friend from West Virginia; and Niederbrock's estranged wife, Debra Kelley, 53, a professor at Longwood University.    McCroskey has been charged only in the killing of Mark Niederbrock. Police and the prosecutor's office did not return repeated phone calls from CNN. But in late September, authorities said more charges are pending.    Emma was described as a fan of Horrorcore and had met McCroskey through their mutual affection for the little-known music genre. Police said she invited McCroskey to fly from his northern California home, stay with her in Virginia and then attend the Strictly for the Wicked Festival, a Horrorcore fest in Michigan featuring bands with names like Dismembered Fetus and Phrozen Body Boy.    Nobody saw what would come next.    The slayings have been the talk of Farmville, a town of 7,000 that is home to Longwood University and nearby Hampden-Sydney College. Senseless is the word you hear most.    It's not just the macabre nature of the killings that has people talking. It's the grotesque lyrics of the Horrorcore singer; it's that it happened under their noses.    McCroskey is a young man with no criminal record who took delight in the blend of horror hip-hop that celebrated macabre killings. He went by the name Syko Sam. In one YouTube video, he holds a hatchet and sings about killing people and putting their remains in black bags: \"Last night I was the murderous rage. Now, I gotta get rid of the bodies before the corpses start to get to rotting.\"    'Stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled'    Authorities have not specified when the Virginia killings occurred, but at 4 a.m. on Friday, September 18, tow-truck driver Elton Napier was called out to Poor House Road to help McCroskey, whose car was stuck.    Napier said McCroskey was wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt and \"was really smelling bad, like real bad. I can't describe it.\"    McCroskey was driving Mark Niederbrock's Honda. Napier said two sheriff's deputies were at the scene and McCroskey was ticketed for driving without a license. At the time, authorities didn't know the pastor had been slain.    When McCroskey hopped into Napier's flatbed, the tow-truck driver said he started gagging from the odor and immediately rolled down the windows.    \"I just held my head out the window so the wind would hit me in the face,\" he said. \"That was the stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled.\"    Napier drove McCroskey about four miles to a convenience store. McCroskey told Napier he was visiting his girlfriend and her father lent him the car. McCroskey fetched a black bag from the Honda before they parted. Napier went inside to get a cup of coffee.    According to police, McCroskey eventually caught a cab to Richmond International Airport. By mid-afternoon that same day, police found the bodies at the home on First Avenue. McCroskey was arrested the next day at the airport, where he had spent the night.    When he was being led to jail, McCroskey told reporters, \"Jesus told me to do it.\"    Suspect's family, community grieve    Sarah McCroskey of California told CNN-affiliate WWBT that her brother had been looking forward to his visit to Virginia for weeks. She mourned his arrest and struggled with the accusations against him. \"I want to hear his voice. I am so concerned, so worried -- not just for him [but] other people, other families involved dealing with this loss,\" she said. Read WWBT's special coverage    Defense attorney Cary Bowen told CNN, \"I don't want to say he's in shock. That's a medical term, but it's a big experience for him. ... I'm not sure he gets the severity of everything right now.\"    The community is still devastated by the events as it struggles to move forward. Memorial services were held over the weekend for Emma Niederbrock and her mother, Debra Kelley.    The Rev. Sylvia Meadows of Farmville United Methodist Church baptized Emma at age 5 and her father when he was an adult. The pastor said the church has invited an occult specialist to speak with members of the community to help them come to grips with the dark side of humanity.    \"We have looked evil in the face and cannot deny that it exists,\" Meadows said. \"God is stronger than evil. God is bigger.\"    Luther Glenn, a member of Walker's Presbyterian Church where Niederbrock was pastor, took issue with McCroskey's comment about Jesus telling him to act. \"I think it's deeply rooted in Satan, if you want to know the truth.\"    Elizabeth McCutchen, who passed the First Avenue home some time after the slayings, said the killings have affected every fabric of the community: the churches, the colleges, and their youth.    \"This is the kind of town that goes to the rescue of survivors, but there's nobody [left] -- we can't do anything about it,\" she said.

Russia's conflict with Georgia in August 2008 strained relations between NATO and Russia.    \"The NATO-Russia Council is up and running again also at the political level,\" said NATO Secretary- General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, speaking at a meeting of ministers in Corfu, Greece.    Russia is not a member of NATO but is a member of the NATO-Russia Council, formed in 2002. It consults, coordinates, reaches joint decisions on and carries out joint action with NATO on areas such as terrorism, cooperation on Afghanistan and military exercises.    Russia and Georgia fought a five-day war in August 2008 over the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia -- the first time Russia sent troops abroad to fight since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.    Differences over that conflict and Russia's subsequent recognition of the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia strained relations between NATO and Russia.    While there are differences of opinions regarding Georgia, Scheffer said member states \"share common security interests,\" including stability in Afghanistan, arms control, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and concerns over drug trafficking, piracy and terrorism.    Scheffer said officials \"are in the process of examining the current institutional structure of the NATO-Russia Council and have agreed to make it a more efficient and valuable instrument for our political dialogue and practical cooperation.\"    Scheffer, who is completing his term as NATO head, said it is the latest time he will chair the NATO-Russia Council as well.

Still, the 39-year-old singer was willing to talk about her beau and her pregnancy, as well as her new album, \"Beautiful Heartache.\"    \"Beautiful Heartache\" was released to iTunes on July 23 by Icon Distribution, Gibson's company, which up until now has handled only soundtracks for his movies.    \"He's an incredible artist,\" Grigorieva said. \"A visionary.

She said she was classically trained as a pianist in her native Russia, and both her parents are musicians.

The world's No. 1 golfer has not been seen in advertisements on American television since November 29 according to media research company Nielsen, with the blackout starting just two days after he crashed his car outside his house -- reportedly following an argument with his wife.      But Nigel Currie, director of international sponsorship agency BrandRapport, believes that although  Woods faces an uncertain corporate future, his marketability will remain if he thinks creatively.      \"It all depends on how long the story will stay on the front page. A story like this makes sponsors very nervous because they don't know if there's more to come,\" he told CNN.      \"Most companies will have a morality clause as part of the contract with a big name like Woods. This is usually enforced because of drugs [or criminal issues], but in a situation like this which is ongoing, there's a good chance these companies will exercise their rights and jump ship.\"      However, while Woods --, the first sportsman to earn $1 billion -- might possibly lose some sponsors, other revenue streams could be exploited, according to Currie. Will Tiger Woods return to golf the same?      \"This chink in his armor won't impact his earning capacity, but companies and brands will think differently in the future. It will open up new offers and close a few doors too,\" he said.      While golf is traditionally a very conservative sport which attracts like minded backers, it is still possible to bring in sponsors even in cases as extreme as John Daly -- whose drinking, smoking and eating problems put his career at risk.      Daly's less than wholesome image paid dividends in 2005 when the American teamed up with restaurant chain Hooters, known for its scantily-clad waitresses, in what seemed a mutually beneficial arrangement.      Hooters vice-president Mike McNeil said in a statement on Daly's Web site: \"John is unique, successful and a man of the people who doesn't really worry too much about what the establishment thinks. In fact he's a lot like Hooters.\"      But the appeal of Daly's carefree attitude also proved to be his downfall when, in November 2008, the golfer was found drunk and face down in a flower bed outside a Hooters restaurant. Earlier this year, Hooters quietly relinquished their contract with the colorful, larger-than-life character.      Another player who has successfully surfed the wave of marketing and endorsement despite a checkered personal life is European golfing legend Nick Faldo.      Despite two divorces and a number of well-documented affairs -- including a three-year liaison with 20-year-old Brenna Cepelak which ended famously with the American student battering Faldo's Porsche with a golf club -- sponsorship has never eluded the golfer.      Faldo also went on to cement his position among the game's elite when he captained the European Ryder Cup team in 2008.      Time will tell if Tiger Woods' self-confessed \"personal failings\" will impact on his career, but his world-beating marketability may have to undergo some change."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/73225639fb2241529d4262c3c1fa852d9b143524.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is BP using to capture the oil?", "id": "107848", "answers": [{"text": "Booms", "answer_start": 5013}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Ben Stone knows quite a bit about disasters.      Five years ago, a 28-foot storm surge from Hurricane Katrina flattened his house and almost wiped out his hometown of Gulfport, Mississippi.      Now, if a rapidly growing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico comes ashore -- as some expect -- Stone will be able to see it from the front porch of his newly-built house.      \"You can get mad about this,\" he said. \"I'm very disturbed about it.\"      Like residents along the coast of Alabama and Florida Panhandle, it is a waiting game for Gulfport.      Already a heavy smell of oil hung over the Mississippi beaches.      \"This could not have happened at a worse time in our history,\" said John Kelly, the town's chief administrative officer.      The city has undertaken half a billion dollars in new construction since Katrina. Of that, $30 million is being spent on developing the harbor -- the third largest container port on the Gulf Coast.      \"Well, it if it threatens the commercial sea lanes, that's a concern because if ships don't come in and ships aren't able to go out, that stops commerce,\" said Donald Allee, the CEO of Mississippi State Port Authority.      Equipment operator Daniel Schepens knows all too well what that will mean.      After Katrina, he was out of work for a month. He is worried the fallout from the spill could be worse.      \"No ships, the warehouses are empty, no trucks, no imports, no exports,\" he said.      Federal officials closed a portion of the northern Gulf of Mexico to fishing Sunday, curtailing a billion-dollar business as high winds and choppy seas hampered efforts to corral a rapidly growing oil spill.      The spill cast a pall over the annual Blessing of the Fleet in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, one of many towns that make their living from the Gulf.      Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana attended a boat blessing in St. Bernard, Louisiana, where fishermen have observed the tradition for decades to usher in the shrimp season.      \"Louisianians are resilient and understand that in times like these, it is our traditions that tie us closer together and provide the strength we need to face the challenges ahead,\" he said.      \"This tragic oil spill has reminded everyone about the valuable connection between our residents and our wildlife, fisheries and coastline.\"      In Venice, Louisiana, a rain-spattered President Obama told reporters his administration has launched a \"relentless response\" to the spill, but said the problem might not be solved for \"many days.\"      A ruptured undersea well off Louisiana is spewing about 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude a day into the Gulf of Mexico, and efforts to shut off the flow have been unsuccessful since the late April explosion that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon.      The leading edge of the slick has grown closer to the coast of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.      Adm. Thad Allen, the commandant of the Coast Guard, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the slick was still nine miles off the Louisiana coast, but seas of 6 to 10 feet have made deploying booms to fend the spill off the coast \"somewhat problematic.\"      Oil giant BP, which owns the well at the heart of the problem, said it had prepared massive boxes to be lowered over the leak points, but deploying them would take about a week.      The minimum 10-day fishing restriction imposed Sunday by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration covers an area between the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to the waters off Florida's Pensacola Bay.      \"Balancing economic and health concerns, this order closes just those areas that are affected by oil,\" NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a statement announcing the decision. \"There should be no health risk in seafood currently in the marketplace.\"      The Gulf Coast's commercial fishing industry brings in about $2.4 billion to the region.      Thomas Rodi, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Mobile, officiated at Sunday's event in Bayou La Batre and said the spill could have \"widespread effects\" on the area -- \"not only the livelihood of people, but an entire way of life.\"      Among those taking part in the blessing was Maurice Ryan, who said, \"You have to put your trust in someone.\"      \"I really feel like, with the church and the bishop, I've got my life in good hands,\" Ryan said. \"BP certainly isn't helping me.\"      The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on BP contractor Transocean Ltd.'s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that left 11 men presumed dead. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said.      \"This event is a self-feeding fire,\" said Richard Charter of the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. \"It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective.\"      The spill will have \"a multidecade impact\" -- a \"long-term poisoning\" of the area, he said.      Booms were strung across the mouths of delta estuaries in Louisiana and inlets along the Mississippi coast.      In Alabama, National Guard troops helped lay them out off Dauphin Island, at the southern end of Mobile Bay.      In Pascagoula, Mississippi, a steady stream of customers stocked up on bags of freshly boiled crawfish, oysters and shrimp. The weekend trade was good, but owner Keith Delcambre said he was worried about the future if the oil slick hits the coast.      \"All I know is seafood,\" he said while sorting crawfish in a small workroom behind the kitchen. \"I don't know what we'll do if this hits. It feels like a hurricane is coming, but what can you do to stop oil?\"      The cause of the blast on the Deepwater Horizon remains unknown.      BP says a device known as a \"blowout preventer\" failed and has not responded to repeated attempts to activate it using remotely operated submarines.      Frustration with BP was growing across the Gulf states, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said the company's response has been inadequate.      But BP America's president, Lamar McKay, told ABC's \"This Week\" that its focus \"is dealing with the source of the oil, dealing with it on the surface, and dealing with it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs.\"      McKay said the company has built a containment system to prevent the leaking oil from spreading. But it may take another six to eight days to deploy that system, which is made up primarily of massive boxes designed to capture the crude.      BP spokeswoman Marti Powers said the company is trying to use remote-controlled submarines to shut off the well at the ocean floor, about 5,000 feet below the surface, and spreading dispersants on and under the water to break up the slick.      The company has put out about 300,000 feet -- roughly 60 miles -- of floating booms to keep the oil away from ecologically sensitive shorelines, she said. But she said efforts to skim oil off the surface were put off because of bad weather.      \"We're hampered because the weather is so bad. Some of the vessels can't get out,\" she said. \"So that slows us down a little bit. But they are still making the effort.

The Federal Aviation Administration released the recording on Thursday, a day after the National Transportation Safety Board said both the plane's engines contained the remains of birds.    Larry King: Carl, what goes through you when you hear the recording, especially the calmness?    Carl Bazarian, survivor: You know, to me -- my son played it for me this morning. I found it incredibly stressful and sobering that we were so close to death. And that's the bad side. And I'm really not keen on hearing it too many more times. But on the other side, it's exhilarating. Again, we were blessed with the best feat in aviation, with the best pilot and co-pilot. That's all I can say.    King: Vince, what goes through your mind?    Vince Spera, survivor: Larry, the entire conversation that you hear going back and forth is just indicative of how the entire cabin was. It was calm, controlled, but tense. That's really what that conversation started to sound like to me.  Listen to pilot's communication with flight controller \u00bb    King: Alberto?    Alberto Panero, survivor: It's filling in pieces to the puzzle. While everything was going on in the plane, we didn't have much information of what was going on actually. So hearing this now kind of fits into the puzzle, where we see where I was at the point when everything was happening in the plane.    King: Brad?    Brad Wentzell, survivor: It's an amazing thing to hear, not only from our perspective, when we were basically going for a ride, but to hear from the man who -- just him and the Good Lord had our lives in his hand.    King: How do you feel, Carl -- you'll see the whole crew with us Tuesday night -- when you hear the captain talk?    Bazarian: First thing, he's very honest about it. But I don't know how -- we all had disbelief. It was all surreal. How then he was so energized to exhibit the highest professionalism. I think it's an incredible aviation feat. And my fellow friends, they will comment. But how did he get that composure?  Watch survivors react to hearing the tape \u00bb    We were all panicky. Not panicky, I think Vince is right. We were kind of cool, but concerned, overly concerned. How did he regain himself and do what he did? I don't know how he did it.    King: Vince, were there a lot of moments, Vince, when you thought you bought it?    Spera: Actually, no. There was never a point in time when I thought I was going to die. Obviously, I think the way the people in the cabin behaved contributed to my feeling that way. It was just a lot of control. We felt like the pilot was in control. Obviously, it all worked out. At no point did I feel like I was going to die. I'm very happy to hear the captain truly didn't feel that way either.    King: Alberto, how about when it hit the water? Did you think you were going to go under?    Panero: No. I think as soon as we hit the water, we realized that the worst was over and the most important thing was to get out as soon as possible, making sure that the doors got open quickly and that everybody stayed calm and tried to exit as calmly as possible, because at first people were trying to get out quick and trying to push a little bit. But I think everybody realized that the more organized that we did it, the faster we would get out. I think that helped out a lot.    King: Brad, the last few weeks, have you had flashbacks? Do you think about it a lot?    Wentzell: I've had a few flashbacks. For me the most real thing that I keep playing back in my head is saying goodbye to my family in prayer and saying goodbye to my little daughter, my loved ones, my wife, and waiting to die. It's a very real feeling. I wasn't as optimistic. No one ever knows when they're going to die. I felt that was my time. Apparently, the Good Lord still has a few things for me to do on this Earth.    King: Carl, you're looking out the window here, I guess.    Bazarian: Yes, I was.    King: What are you thinking?    Bazarian: The first reality when we hit, I thought, initially, the landing was so good I thought we were back on the tarmac. That was my immediate reaction. But then the water -- immediately, we saw the water out the window. Again, like Vince said, when we saw that daylight of the door opening, it wasn't a herd of people trying to rush out. It was pretty good composure. I guess Vince is right. We picked up on the courage of the crew and the flight attendants.    King: Vince, there was one passenger who thought he landed.    Spera: Yes. I heard several stories about reactions of different people. Honestly, most of the people knew exactly what was going on and they really just wanted to get out and get to safety. But I did hear somebody attempting to pick up their bag and do some other things like that. Fortunately, most of those people were on the right side of the plane. I got to get out the left.    King: Alberto, have you flown since?    Panero: Actually, I have. The next day I took a plane home. I figured that was going to be the easiest way to just get over any kind of possible trauma, just get back on the plane. And I just kept focused on seeing my family and friends and that got me through the flight pretty well. And also the lady that was sitting next to me was very nice and just happened to make friendly conversation. So it worked out pretty good.    Panero: Brad, have you met the captain?    Wentzell: I did meet the captain. That was very real thing. He's just as cool and calm in person as you would expect, for someone who was able to do, from what I believe, no one else on the planet could do. He was very humble. I think we all have been humbled from this experience."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f5f6db49aae94ae2644d2886fd6b2a6d2ab24c71.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who was evacuated?", "id": "107850", "answers": [{"text": "The entire population of Taloga, Oklahoma,", "answer_start": 10}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- The entire population of Taloga, Oklahoma, was evacuated Thursday because of a raging fire that has burned tens of thousands of acres, officials said Friday.

Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan leaves the stage Thursday, as Israeli President Shimon Peres sits, left.      Peres said he and Erdogan did not take the spat personally.      \"I called him up and said, yes, it's nothing against you, nothing against Turkey. We consider you as a friend,\" Peres said. He said Erdogan reciprocated.      Although there was no mention of an apology, Peres said there was a polite exchange between the two leaders.      \"I didn't take it personally. I didn't go for a personal fight. I answered unfounded accusations. It was my duty. And they didn't change my mind,\" he said.  Watch Shimon Peres on the Gaza conflict \u00bb      Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation, has long been the Jewish state's closest military and economic partner in the region, and Turkey recently mediated indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria.      But many Turks have been incensed with Israel over its three-week military operation that ended there earlier this month.      And in Davos, Erdogan was angered after Peres said that Israel is committed to peace and blamed Hamas for the fighting in Gaza, where Israel staged a three-week military operation that ended earlier this month.      When Erdogan began responding, a moderator cut him off, saying the debate had run over its allotted time. Erdogan patted the moderator on the arm until he was granted one more minute to respond.  Watch commentary on Erdogan's angry exchange \u00bb      \"I know the reason behind raising your voice is because of the guilty psychology,\" he said to Peres. \"My voice will not be that loud. You must know that. When it comes to killing -- you know killing very well. I know how you hit, kill children on the beaches.\"      He then left the stage, complaining that Peres was receiving preferential treatment.      \"From now on, Davos is finished for me,\" Erdogan said. \"I will not come back. You won't let people talk. You gave him 25 minutes, but you gave me 12 minutes. This is not right.\"      Erdogan had described the military campaign against Hamas fighters in Gaza as \"barbaric\" and accused Israel of using excessive force.      He said: \"The Palestinian Territories are like an open-air prison, isolated from the world. I have always been a leader who said anti-Semitism is a crime against humanity. But so is anti-Islamism.\"      Peres had said Hamas was responsible for the \"tragedy,\" accusing the Islamist militants of creating a \"dangerous dictatorship.\"      \"Israel left Gaza completely -- no occupation,\" Peres said. \"I want to understand why they throw rockets at us.\"      On Friday, after his outburst, Erdogan returned home to a hero's welcome. Thousands of people lined up at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, cheering and waving signs. A large banner read, \"You Will Never Walk Alone,\" and smaller signs bore phrases including \"Davos Conqueror.\" People also were seen waving Turkish and Palestinian flags and throwing flowers on the road leading to Erdogan's home.      Despite the glowing response at the airport, there has been some criticism in the Turkish media of Erdogan's exchange with the Israeli president.      CNN Turk's Deniz Bayramoglu said the issue was still \"hot\" with Erdogan's secularist political opponents speaking out against the prime minister.      \"They also say that Israel's behavior in Gaza is unacceptable but they are very critical of Prime Minister Erdogan's behavior,\" Bayramoglu said.      \"Some are saying they are really proud of Prime Minister Erdogan and some are saying it is a diplomatic scandal.\"      Erdogan explained whom he was directing his anger at during a news conference at the airport. \"My words were only to the Israeli government, not the Israeli people,\" he said.

Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA.    HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville.    But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood.    \"It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,\" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc.    \"There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward. Even if you look at coming over here during our enslavement, we were brought here to cultivate the land because that's something we did on the continent. So really, that's what many of the people are doing now,\" he said.    Myers believes urban farming is a way for many African-Americans to reconnect with their past. iReport.com: Show us your urban farm    \"They are going through a process of Sankofa and going to what they traditionally did, which is connect to the Earth so they can move forward and grow,\" he says.    But HABESHA Gardens isn't unique.    Former pro basketball player Will Allen, who is considered to be one of the nation's leading urban farmers and founder of Growing Power Inc., estimates that there are hundreds of thousands of urban gardens in inner cities across America.  Urban farms help feed people, sustain neighorhoods \u00bb  \"It's beyond a movement at this point. Its more like a revolution,\" says Allen.    Both Allen and Myers agree that the boom in urban farming for African-Americans is born out of necessity and not just echoing traditions.    \"Minority people are affected by poor food, more than any other groups,\" and many inner cities lack access to quality fruits and vegetables, Allen says. \"Our food system is broken.\"    \"When you're poor, when you don't have access to resources, you have to create your own,\" says Myers. \"So this is a way for people of African descent to use their creativity to grow their own food.\"    Many poorer communities don't have full-scale grocery stores. Allen charges that companies have red-lined those areas and won't build stores there.    So community activists like Myers have taken up the fight.    \"[Starting] community gardens in local communities, specifically in urban areas, is important, so you create your own food security network,\" says Myers. \"You're not relying on large grocery stores to provide food for everyone because if those grocery stores have problems, your access to food is done.\"    HABESHA Gardens makes the fresh food accessible to people in Mechanicsville by opening up the garden to people in the community every Sunday from noon to 4 p.m.    \"We invite people from the local community here, the immediate community but also from the greater Atlanta community ... to come out, work in the garden; learn, reconnect with the Earth and also be able to take food home with them after the harvest.\"    In addition to providing food for those that work in garden, HABESHA partners with organizations such as the Atlanta Community Food Bank and the MLK Senior Center to provide food from the garden to the hungry and elders in the community.    HABESHA is more than just an urban garden. HABESHA, an acronym for Helping Africa By Establishing Schools at Home and Abroad. The organization mentors young African-Americans by sending them on a yearly trip to Ghana and educates the youth in Mechanicsville through the garden's after-school program called Sustainable Seeds.    \"Not only are we teaching them about agriculture, [we're] teaching them about solar technology, rainwater catching,\" Myers says. \"A majority of the food that was planted here was done by the youth in the after-school program. They helped to build the shed, they helped to build the greenhouse, they helped to build the shade nursery ... They are very much a vital part of the process that goes on here.\"    Malik Parks, 12, is a member of HABESHA's mentoring program.    \"Well, it feeds us. That's a big thing -- to know that we're helping the earth. Us planting it, that gives us exercise; then also, eating it gives us nutrients,\" says Parks.    Sporting a \"Black to Our Roots\" T-shirt, Parks is already well aware of the higher purpose he and HABESHA have with their garden.    \"I believe to some, its hope. I know there are a lot of people over here that live in poverty. I know you can come and pick food, so that's food for them,\" Parks says. \"So it's hope to stay alive longer and be energized and do what you have to do to get back on your feet.\"    Myers, who is his mentor, agrees.    \"We encourage the people in the community to come, be a part of the process of growing the food, so it's more empowerment than it is giving as charity,\" says Myers.    And with urban farms like Will Allen's becoming half-million dollar enterprises in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois, and many other farms in New York City and Detroit, Michigan, urban gardening is spreading like the roots of the vegetables they grow.    \"This has become a multicultural, multigenerational movement, a revolution,\" says Allen. \"This isn't just the hippies and tree huggers. Everyone is getting on board. It's really exciting.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/53be44aecb6deecb7eb8bc9fce774df89de4b059.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is difficult to access?", "id": "107859", "answers": [{"text": "Okavango Delta", "answer_start": 13}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The Okavango Delta is one of earth's remote places; it is not easy to get to, and it is quite wild. Independent travel there is not for the inexperienced or the faint-hearted.      There are few roads and those that exist are difficult to drive and navigate and subject to flooding and other hazards; communications are spotty at best and locations are distantly apart.      Winning and losing on Botswana's Okavango Delta      The vast majority of tourists fly into camps in the delta, many from the town of Maun, which is easily reached by scheduled airlines from Botswana's capital, Gaborone (Air Botswana), from Johannesburg, South Africa (South African Airways), from Windhoek, Namibia (Air Namibia), and from Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. From Maun, a host of bush plane companies fly tourists to the camps and reserves, most of which, including Kwara, are privately owned and operated.      Most tourists make their arrangements through organized tour companies, and there is no shortage of tour operators in southern Africa who can arrange an all-inclusive visit. More resourceful travelers can save money by making their own arrangements using the Internet to identify individual camps, and arranging transportation and accommodations directly through them. The camps vary from luxury suites to basic pup tents, and prices reflect the differences.      Kwara Camp is mid- to upper range, offering heavy canvas tents on wood platforms with full beds and in-tent plumbed bathrooms, full board and a host of activities, including overland Jeep safaris, dugout canoe trips and motorboat journeys that are included in the basic price.      Less expensive camps, such as Oddballs Camp, feature simple pup tents on platforms, but can be hundreds of dollars less expensive. Some camps are fenced to keep animals out at night, while others such as Kwara are not (if the sound of a two-ton elephant or hippopotamus tramping through the bushes right outside your window unnerves you, you might want to opt for a fenced camp).      Botswana is deliberately expensive, as the government wishes to limit the number of tourists who visit Okavango to lessen environmental impact. Rates during high season (July-October) can be twice as high as during low season (November-June). Try going during low season, just before or after high season, to maximize wildlife viewing but minimize cost.      For most upscale camps, plan on US $900-$1,600 per person, per night in high season, and a low of about $700 in low season. For mid-range camps, plan on about $700-$950 in high season, as low as $350 in low season. For basic camps, looks for rates as low as $340 per person, per night in high season and $240 in low season. Most rates are all-inclusive, including lodging, food and all safaris and other activities. Tourists on tighter budgets might want to consider camps in South Africa, although they tend to be less wild and more tourist-populated.      Large animals including lion, zebra, hippopotamus, wildebeest, elephant and others are abundant in the Delta, and while it is thrilling to see them, tourists must always remember, this is not a zoo. The animals are wild. But as long as visitors follow a few simple rules, there is little danger."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/1ee1d9882a23d4032ec6d9ade5a60f802977774c.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What caused the residents to be evacuated?", "id": "107860", "answers": [{"text": "Tropical Storm", "answer_start": 88}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (CNN)  -- After earning a reputation as a killer in Haiti, Tropical Storm Hanna amounted to little more than a windy rainstorm along the Atlantic Coast on Saturday.    Water almost covers the dock at the Marine Corps Air Station marina near the New River in North Carolina.    No states have \"expressed any damage that they couldn't handle,\" said Glenn Cannon, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's assistant administrator for disaster operations.    He said there were some concerns about flooding near rivers and in low-lying areas.    \"We're monitoring Hanna, but it seems to be a heavy rain event,\" he said.    According to the Associated Press, Hanna did cause one death in a traffic accident on Interstate 95 in Maryland.    Many people in Huntington, Virginia, about 8 miles northwest of Virginia Beach, voluntarily evacuated Saturday afternoon because of concerns about flooding, Fairfax County public information officer Merni Fitzgerald said. The area, which has flooded in the past, was receiving heavy rain, she said.    She could not provide an exact number of people who had evacuated.    The storm drenched the Carolinas and Virginia with heavy rain pushed by 55-mph winds as it zipped northward near 30 mph (48 kph), the National Hurricane Center reported at 11 p.m. ET Saturday.    At that hour, the center of the storm was 90 miles (145 kilometers) west-southwest of Long Island, New York, and about 135 miles (220 kilometers) southwest of Providence, Rhode Island. Hanna would travel the coast all the way up to Canada's Maritime Provinces by Sunday night, forecasters said.    Hanna came ashore at 3:20 a.m. ET near the North Carolina-South Carolina state line.    It caused a surge of 1 to 2 feet of water along the shore and was expected to deliver 4 to 6 inches of rain, with some areas getting more.    Flooding, wind damage and power outages were minor across the Carolinas, according to emergency officials.  View a map of Hanna's projected path \u00bb    \"It's actually going fairly well, with some reports of minor flooding,\" said South Carolina Emergency Management spokesman Derrec Becker.    About 10,000 South Carolina homes were without power Saturday morning, mostly in the Myrtle Beach area, Becker said. He also said 444 South Carolina residents were staying in 15 shelters.    In North Carolina, nearly 12,000 homes had no electricity, mostly in the counties near where Hanna came in, said State Emergency Management spokesman Mark Van Sciver.  See what impact Hanna had on Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina \u00bb    No deaths were reported, flooding was limited, and no highways were closed, Van Sciver said.    Nearly 1,500 residents sought refuge Saturday in 49 emergency shelters in North Carolina, Van Sciver said.    The storm snarled some travel plans. It triggered delays for arrivals to Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania and departures from Newark International Airport in New Jersey and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Delays at JFK airport averaged about four hours, the FAA said.    Hanna's eye made landfall near Little River Inlet at the South Carolina-North Carolina line, according to CNN meteorologists.  Watch wind whip a South Carolina beach \u00bb    Pounding waves flattened some sand dunes on the beaches at Oak Island, North Carolina, just east of the storm's landfall.    The island's Ocean Crest pier, rebuilt after Hurricane Floyd destroyed it nine years ago, held up under Hanna, but the American flag flying above it was in tatters and barely attached to its pole by sunrise.    By Saturday afternoon, the hurricane center had discontinued a tropical storm warning southward from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.    A tropical storm warning covered much of the East Coast from Cape Hatteras to Merrimack River, Massachusetts, about 31 miles north of Boston.    The warning included all of Chesapeake Bay, Washington, New York Harbor and Long Island Sound, as well as popular vacation islands Martha's Vineyard, Block Island and Nantucket.    The warning means tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area within the next 24 hours. iReport.com: Are you getting soaked?    Hanna caused severe flooding and killed at least 137 as it lingered for several days over and just off the coast of Haiti.    U.N. relief supplies started arriving in the beleaguered country Friday, even as Hurricane Ike threatens to do even more damage.    Ike will pass near or over the Turks and Caicos Islands, just north of Haiti, and the southeastern Bahamas in the next day, the hurricane center said.    Ike's impact on the United States is less certain, but it could brush South Florida and hit the Gulf Coast as a major hurricane next week. iReport.com: \"There's now a pond in my car\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a9a2880bd65c6b3835d19987ebcbd3d09010a0c3.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What do less serious disputes involve?", "id": "107861", "answers": [{"text": "the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco, a grape liquor.", "answer_start": 2397}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuters) -- Chile called home its ambassador in Peru on Monday, as a dispute flared over disputed maritime territory between the South American neighbors.

Peru's foreign minister, Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde, sought to downplay the row.    \"It is an absolutely common diplomatic practice in novel situations like this that garner attention that ambassadors are called (back to report),\" he said.    \"The channels of dialogue and communication must be kept open, and the countries must work toward a positive agenda,\" Garcia Belaunde said.    The sea border, set in the 1950s, starts close to the land border and cuts due west across the ocean. But Peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles (37,900 sq km) of fishing waters.    Its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the Pacific Ocean.    Analysts say Peru will have its day in court and the Hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved, unless something happens to escalate the debate.    \"The only thing that could happen, which would be very worrisome, would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty (in those waters) now that Peru officially claims them. That would be a shame,\" said Ricardo Israel, a political analyst in Chile.    Chile defeated Peru in the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor. The two countries have strong economic ties but relations are still rocky.    The dispute over their sea border has bubbled anew over the past two years and comes in addition to less serious disputes over the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco, a grape liquor.    Peru and Chile are the world's top producers of fish meal, a cattle feed, and fishing is one of the engines of Peru's economy.

The Jets have banned the sale of alcohol on Sunday at the stadium they've called home for 26 years.      \"With the late start of Sunday's game, coupled with this being the final regular season and final game at the stadium, we feel it is prudent not to serve alcohol,\" said Bruce Speight, a spokesman for the team.      The Jets approach the decision of whether to serve alcohol on a game-by-game basis, Speight said. Fresh off a victory over the formerly undefeated Indianapolis Colts, the Jets are on the verge of their first play-off berth in three years -- and fans are riled up and ready to go.      And Jets fans are known for rowdy behavior -- for example, a half-time \"tradition\" of women baring their breasts for men who loudly urge them to do so. In lieu of alcohol, the Jets said, they'll pass out green and white \"rowdy towels\" to the first 70,000 fans arriving at the stadium.      But the ban has raised the ire of a New Jersey vodka distillery. Majorska Vodka, which calls itself \"one of the largest liquor companies in the Garden State,\" is calling for a 24-hour boycott of Johnson & Johnson products because, according to company spokesman Jeff Scott, Jets owner Woody Johnson is the \"heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune.\"      Scott said Majorska plans to stop paying for three of their executive's seats at the Meadowlands and that the company is set to lose more than $100,000 in revenue from tailgate parties this weekend.      The New York Jets officially declined to comment, but team spokesman Speight said that \"negative fan reaction has been minimal at best\" and pointed out that vodka is not sold anywhere in the stadium and the ban does not apply to tailgating.      But Martin Silver, Majorska's president and CEO, said fans are shocked and outraged that the Jets are treating their supporters \"like children.\"      Silver, a life-long Jets backer with a Joe Namath jersey hanging in his office, is directing his frustration at the team's ownership because he feels they are \"controlling the game completely.\" He said his company is distributing anti-Johnson & Johnson petitions Friday to 350 sports bars across New Jersey.      \"We're taking this on, right to the top, to Johnson,\" said Silver.      Woody Johnson is the grandson of Johnson & Johnson founder Robert Wood Johnson, but is not currently connected to the company. William C. Weldon is the company's chairman and CEO. None of the Johnson family serves on the company's management team or board of directors.      Johnson & Johnson spokesman Bill Price said that \"officially we have no comment given that the Johnson family has had no managerial role with the company for decades.\"      Giants Stadium, part of the Meadowlands Sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, has been home to both the Jets and the New York Giants, who played their first game there on October 10, 1976.      Early on during their tenancy at Giants Stadium, the Jets refered to the 82,000-seat arena simply as \"the Meadowlands\" although in recent years Jets tickets have used the facility's official name.      The stadium, which has hosted popes, concerts and major league soccer as well as football, is to be demolished after this season. Both New York teams will move into a new stadium just a short distance away next season.      That stadium will get its name from a corporate sponsor, yet to be named.

A French search and rescue crew scans the Atlantic for wreckage Tuesday.    No survivors have been found, he said.    Jobim made the announcement after meeting with relatives and friends of Brazilians who were among the 228 people aboard Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France.    Two debris fields were found about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands, an archipelago 355 kilometers (220 miles) off the northeast coast of Brazil -- or at latitude 2 north, longitude 30 west, the Ministry of Defense said on its Web site.    One of the fields was 5 km (3 miles) long and that both lie near the flight path between Rio de Janeiro and Paris.    Among the wreckage was an airplane seat, metal debris, an orange float, a drum and an oil spill, the posting said.  See map of suspected crash zone \u00bb    Brazilian air force planes spotted the debris field Tuesday morning, but it was not until a French commercial vessel arrived on the scene that the debris' origin was confirmed. The planes searched 10,000 square kilometers (3,861 square miles) of ocean throughout the day and will continue to search for more debris overnight, the Brazilian Air Force Said.    Two Netherlands-flagged vessels were expected to arrive in the area later in the day; a Brazilian navy ship was expected to arrive Wednesday, officials said. Brazilian air force jets were continuing to comb the area for other debris, and a U.S. P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft was assisting as well.  Watch how wreckage has been spotted in Atlantic \u00bb    The searchers also want to find the cockpit voice and data recorders, which might shed light on what caused the jet to disappear before any of the three pilots was able to issue a mayday.    \"That really is an ominous sign,\" said former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board Managing Director Peter Goelz. \"It means, whatever happened, it happened so quickly that the pilots were not able to radio out. It probably indicates a catastrophic failure at altitude.\"    He said that meteorologists have been checking weather data over the area \"to see if there was some phenomenon that was taking place -- so far, we haven't seen it.\"    The Airbus A330 encountered heavy turbulence early Monday, about three hours into what was supposed to be an 11-hour flight, according to the airline.    The plane carried 216 passengers -- 126 men, 82 women, seven children and a baby -- and 12 crew members, Air France said.    The majority of the people on the flight came from Brazil, France and Germany. Other victims were from 29 other countries, including three from the United States. Of the crew, 11 were French, and one was Brazilian.    A team of approximately 20 Air France staff members, including two doctors and a nurse, arrived Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro to assist families of the victims, the airline said.    An inter-religious ceremony is to be held Wednesday afternoon inside Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral for family and friends of the victims. Though it will be closed to news media, a sound recording of the ceremony will be broadcast into the square outside.    An official list of victims by name was not available Tuesday afternoon, but two Americans on board -- Michael Harris, 60, and his wife, Anne, 54 -- were identified by the couple's family and his employer.    Prince Pedro Luis de Orleans e Braganca, a member of Brazil's non-reigning royal family, was also on the flight, his family said Monday. Pedro Luis was 26.    Also on the flight were two executives of the French tire company Michelin: Michelin Latin America President Luiz Roberto Anastacio and Antonio Gueiro, director of informatics. Read more about victims on Air France Flight 447    The jet was 4 years old and had last undergone routine maintenance April 16.    The Air France plane has built-in homing devices, said Greg Feith, a former investigator with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.    Homing devices such as \"pingers,\" which are underwater locator beacons attached to flight data and cockpit voice recorders, can transmit signals from as deep as 14,000 feet, about the maximum depth of the waters in the area.    The average depth of the Atlantic Ocean is about 12,000 feet: more than 2 miles.    \"They're water-activated, so if they're sitting at the bottom of the ocean, of course, then the military assets will have to go in there with listening devices and try and home in on those particular signals,\" Feith said.    Shortly before it disappeared, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating that \"several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down,\" Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said Monday.    The jet, which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph, also sent a warning that it had lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said.    There was no contact with the crew during or after the time that the automatic messages were sent, Gourgeon said.    \"It was probable that it was a little bit after those messages that the impact of the plane took place in the Atlantic,\" he added.

Donald Trump says President Obama is trying to solve the nation's economic woes, but it's \"trial and error.\"  Trump spoke with CNN's Larry King about whether there should be executive pay limits, if there should be a stimulus plan and when there could be an end to the economic downturn. The following is an edited portion of the interview.  Larry King: Is Obama right or wrong to go after these executives with salary caps?  Donald Trump: Well, I think he's absolutely right. Billions of dollars is being given to banks and others. You know, once you start using taxpayer money, it's a whole new game. So I absolutely think he's right.  King: What about the whole concept of bailouts?  Trump: Well, it's a little bit different. A lot of people are not in favor of bailouts. You know, we talked about all the different things going on in this country. Let's face it, Larry, we are in a depression.  If they didn't do the bailout, you would be in depression No. 2 and maybe just as big as depression No. 1, so they really had to do something. The problem is they're giving millions and billions of dollars to banks and the banks aren't loaning it.  If you are a prime customer of a bank and if you need 10 cents, you can't get it. The banks are out of business. They're not loaning. Now, billions of dollars has been given. They're supposed to be loaning out that money and they're using it for other purposes, so it is a real mess.  King:  If you were in the Senate, would you vote for the stimulus plan?  Trump: Well, I'd vote for a stimulus plan. I'm not sure that all of the things in there are appropriate. Some of the little toys that they have are not really appropriate, and they're a little surprising that they seem to want it, because the publicity on it has been terrible.  I would certainly vote for a stimulus, but I would really vote for banks having to loan out the money because they're not doing that.  King: In your adult career, have you ever seen it worse?  Trump: No, this is the worst ever. This is the worst I've ever seen. 1990 was a bad period of time, but this is far worse, and this is worse on a really global basis. I'm looking at different countries. Every country is bad. Now they're blaming us because of what happened. You know, why not blame the United States? But every country is in trouble.  King:  Can you put the blame anywhere?  Trump: Well, look, it's something that, to a certain extent, happens. You go up, you go down. You have recessions. If you just look at the charts over the period of 150 years, you've had good times (and) you've had bad times.  Certainly, there's been a lot of greed. There's been a lot of stupidity. You know, like I say, today the banks don't have money, they don't loan money. But if you went to a bank two years ago and you wanted a $300 million loan, they'd say 'No, we don't want to do that, but we'll give you $400 million,' so I guess, to a certain extent, that's part of the problem.  King:  If you had the power, if you could wield, what would you do?  Trump: Well, the biggest problem we have is it's trial and error, Larry. I mean we've never had anything like this before. It is absolute trial and error. They're trying. The new president is trying. Bush left him with a mess -- a total mess in many different ways. I really think he's doing the best he can, but it is trial and error.  They try something, if it works, great. If it doesn't work -- and the problem is you don't really know if it's going to work for quite some time. If it's really wrong -- and it could be wrong -- we're going to really have a mess in two years."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/b3d2bad39bce2882642985169c0a3c41e5d90431.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did doctors help?", "id": "107875", "answers": [{"text": "Joplin, Missouri,", "answer_start": 257}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Struck by lightning, caught up in the smell of gas, braving two-inch hail and relentless rain: None of it could stop hundreds of firefighters, police officers, medical personnel, National Guardsmen and more from heading into the devastation around Joplin, Missouri, in a desperate search for survivors.      Nor could the fact that many of the first responders searched through the rubble of buildings at the same time many of their own homes had been eviscerated. Amidst the struggles, there were victories: 17 people were rescued Monday, city manager Mark Rohr told CNN's Eliot Spitzer.      \"They've lost their homes, but they have been out there for 40 hours saving lives,\" Richard Serino, deputy administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said from Joplin. \"The work they have done ... to say it is to be commended is an understatement.\"      Not much more than 12 hours after the tornado touched down, Rohr said that between 400 to 500 firefighters, public works personnel and other municipal employees showed up Monday morning, unasked, hoping to help.      The city manager said that the turnout, and the fact many others who have pitched in in other ways, is no surprise in Joplin, a city of 50,050 residents in southwest Missouri.      \"Joplin is a city of neighbors helping neighbors,\" he said. \"And with this spirit, we will overcome the hardship.\"      Yet the continually confounding weather Monday proved a major challenge. Rohr said that two first responders were struck by lightning while looking through debris -- he did not detail the victims' conditions afterward -- with persistent thunderstorms prompting a temporary halt to the searches.      And even by Monday evening, a full day after the twister struck, Rohr said there were \"gas leaks all over the city.\"      \"When we drive around, we can smell the gas,\" the city manager said. \"And there are wires down everywhere. You have just got to be careful, as you navigate through the city.\"      The challenge doesn't appear likely to get any easier Tuesday. The National Weather Service has said there is a 45 percent chance of another tornado outbreak between 4 p.m. and midnight Tuesday over a wide swath that includes cities like Dallas, Oklahoma City and -- yet again -- Joplin.      Those assisting in the rescue effort weren't just from Joplin. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon noted that some of the more than 1,000 first responders came from Kansas City and other locales. That doesn't include the 110 highway patrolmen and 250 National Guardsmen -- with another 450 on standby -- also on the scene.      Dr. Jim Roscoe told CNN that doctors, nurses and others rushed to help, after the tornado ripped through St. John's Regional Medical Center. Even with often impassible roads and treacherous weather, he said that, \"within a matter of hours, we had almost more help than we could put to use.\"      \"I just can't begin to tell you,\" said Roscoe, who is heading the hospital's triage unit as it treats and redirects patients coming in for help. \"We've had people coming from several hundreds of miles away, grabbing their stethoscope and anything they could get, and threw it in their car and came.\"      Whether treating patients and searching for bodies, those on the frontlines in Joplin also face a significant psychological toll of dealing with devastation that most of them have never seen before. Nixon said they would likely have \"very difficult shifts, (because) there are going to see things out there that are hard to see and hard to stomach.\"      Still, voicing a sentiment echoed by officials and residents in Joplin, the governor said it wouldn't prevent the first responders from heading out again, looking for survivors.      \"We are going to cover every foot of this town, and we're going to make sure that every person is accounted for,\" Nixon said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/737370b6f63e5bb55e089a9055a07c6951efdf2b.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Suresh Raina hits unbeaten what for chennei?", "id": "107876", "answers": [{"text": "57", "answer_start": 425}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- Chennai Super Kings won the third staging of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as they beat Mumbai Indians by 22 runs in the final of the Twenty20 tournament on Sunday.

The arrest took place about 12:20 a.m. in Miami's South Beach area. Officers said they saw the Freightliner truck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on South Beach's Ocean Drive with some 13 people inside, including a woman sitting on the lap of Starks, who was driving.    The truck's seating capacity is four occupants, the police report said. It was not clear from the police report whether the Freightliner -- normally part of a tractor-trailer -- was connected to a trailer.    In the report, the officer recalled pursuing the truck on foot for about a half-block and pounding on the rear driver's-side window, but it kept moving. The officer caught up to the truck again, and it stopped after the officer pounded on the window again, the report said.    \"I slowly approached the side door and just as I reached it the vehicle accelerated and started moving forward and slightly to the left,\" the unidentified officer writes in the report. \"The vehicle's path caused the driver's side of the vehicle to strike me in the chest pushing me back and pinning me against a vehicle stopped in traffic in the northbound lane.\"    Meanwhile, a second officer was pounding on the passenger's-side window, the report said. The truck stopped, and Starks was arrested.    A police check showed that the truck's license plate was not assigned to that vehicle, the report said, and Starks faces a charge for that as well.    Starks was released from jail later Sunday, according to a records check. The Miami Herald newspaper reported earlier he was jailed on $10,000 bond.

But then again, she might be the only entertainer in Nashville who owns a clothing boutique.    Holly Williams is daughter of musician Hank Williams Jr. and granddaughter of musician Hank Williams Sr.    The chic women's store is named H. Audrey after her maternal grandmother, who was the first wife of the late country music icon Hank Williams. Holly's father is Bocephus -- the legendary hellraiser and three-time CMA Entertainer of the Year otherwise known as Hank Williams Jr.    She got her height from him. With heels on, she's about 6-foot-3 -- all tanned legs and long, blonde hair. She looks like a star. And at 28, she wants to earn the right to be one.    Williams just released her sophomore album, \"Here With Me\" (Mercury Nashville). Most of the 11 tracks are self-penned, and she sings them with emotional honesty in a smoky, soulful voice. The characters in her lyrics are friends, family and lovers from the past. She also has a man in her present: On July 24, she became engaged to Chris Coleman, the drummer in her band.  Watch Williams show off her talents \u00bb    Williams spoke with CNN about her new album and her family's legacy. The following is an edited version of the interview.    CNN: Your new album was released the same day as your dad's new album. Was that planned?    Holly Williams: It wasn't planned at all. About three weeks before my release, I was looking over to see who else was coming out that day, and it said, \"Hank Jr.\" -- and I'm going, \"Is this something my manager planned?\" And it's just so random, because out of the 52 weeks of the year, it just happened.    CNN: What did he think about the album?    Williams: Well, this is embarrassing, but I haven't sent him a copy yet! I need to. He's heard two of the singles. He's always been a huge supporter of the songwriting, and just been a great encourager with me.    CNN: What was it like when you were growing up?    Williams: Well, my mom raised my sister and me. [My parents] split when we were 3 and 5, and he was touring 300 nights a year. We'd see him every few months when he was off the road, and we'd go up there and hunt and fish and be on the farm. But my mom did all the rules and curfews and all that.    CNN: Your mother doesn't seem jaded by the music industry at all.    Williams: Oh, she doesn't at all. They split in '83, so when they first got married in '77, he was still a struggling artist and doing small theater shows. My single out right now is called \"Mama\" that I wrote ... is kind of a thank-you song, because she was always the most positive influence -- had so much light. My dad always talks about what a great mom she was, and they're still close friends.    CNN: What was it like for you going into the music industry? Was there a lot of pressure?    Williams: The songwriting hit me at a very young age. Eight, 9, 10 is when I started writing. Went away from it for a few years, and at 17 picked up a guitar and it was just on from there. I'm 28 now, and I've been doing it for 10 years nonstop. I put out an EP myself when I was 20, and paid 200 bucks for my Web site, and traveled over in the U.K. alone with a backpack.    And in the U.S., I just took my mom's Suburban and followed everyone from Train, John Mellencamp, Billy Bob Thornton -- everyone's bus -- and just did any show I could, whether they paid or not. Just played, played, played.    CNN: Do you remember the first song you wrote when you were 8?    Williams: I do. The first song I wrote was called \"Who Am I,\" and it's funny because it was very serious. I had a very happy childhood, but it was very introspective about this broken marriage, and I wanted Tiffany or Debbie Gibson to cut it. I remember just telling my mom, \"Just please call the publishing company. ... \"I was so ambitious. I remember making cassette tapes and mailing them to Music Row.    CNN: What was the reaction from those tapes?    Williams: I'm sure there was never any response. I'm sure people just laughed. I was not as talented as Taylor Swift when I was 15, 16. I could write a decent song, but I couldn't sing that well at that age.    CNN: You have a love for rock 'n' roll. Why did you go into country with this album?    Williams: Growing up in my house, you would assume I was growing up around country music with my dad being Hank Williams Jr. But he did not bring music home. He always said, \"I'm not Bocephus to you. I'm Daddy.\" So I was really left to my own devices to find music on my own.    And I really fell in love with the singer-songwriters of the '70s -- Tom Waits, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Carole King -- that whole era really struck me. And when I heard Hank Williams Sr.'s name mentioned from those people -- from Leonard Cohen to Bruce Springsteen -- that's what really brought me back around to learning more about my grandfather.    My music is still based in that singer-songwriter tradition. Adding a fiddle and steel guitar makes it more country, and adding blazing electric guitars makes it more rock. I'm on a country label now.    CNN: You also own a clothing boutique in Nashville called H. Audrey.    Williams: Everything I have on, except my shoes, is from there. ... It's a struggle in this economy, but we make enough to pay our payroll and buy the clothes. And it's nice to fold jeans every now and again, and get my mind out of myself.    CNN: When you're writing down your goals on your wish list, what is it you really want?    Williams: I would love to sell a million records. I would love to play in arenas -- but what I really want to build is a core fanbase, and just hopefully build a place in the Williams family."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/c8024dcf38178d62aa28c551be518b96ea70c451.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what country is it happening near", "id": "107880", "answers": [{"text": "Somalia,", "answer_start": 2349}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Twenty-eight suspected pirates were taken into custody Friday by the European Union Naval Force after a handful of failed attacks on fishing vessels in the Indian Ocean, the EU mission said.      In the first incident, the mission intercepted a mother ship and two skiffs early Friday in the southern Indian Ocean between the Seycelles and Mombasa, Kenya. The mission said the suspected pirates were in an area where an earlier attack had occurred.      A helicopter from the French warship FS Nivose then tracked the vessels and saw the suspects throwing things overboard, the mission said.      When a French team arrived at the scene, it found 11 suspected pirates and \"pirate paraphernalia\" in the skiffs: a rocket launcher, grappling hooks and several fuel barrels.      The forces destroyed the pirate ship and a skiff and took the suspected pirates into custody. The fate of the second skiff was not immediately known.      Soon after, pirates tried to attack a French fishing vessel near two other fishing boats, said Cmdr. John Harbour, spokesman for the EU Naval Force.      The French fishing vessel collided with the suspected pirates' vessel and sank it, Harbour said. Six suspected pirates were picked out of the water by the EU force, he said. It was not immediately clear if they had been transported to the FS Nivose, although that had been planned, he said.      Later, pirates tried to attack a Spanish fishing vessel, Harbour said. The boat alerted the EU Naval Force, and air and naval units intervened, he said.      Eleven suspected pirates were taken into custody and were on board the Nivose, Harbour said.      Harbour said an increase in pirate attacks was likely over the next few weeks as the monsoon season was ending and the ocean was becoming calmer, he said.      \"The pirates have been preparing for it. ... We are prepared as well,\" he said.      On Thursday, pirates on two skiffs in the Indian Ocean attacked the Spanish fishing vessel Albacan, the EU Naval Force said. The pirates fired a rocket-propelled grenade, which exploded on the Albacan's deck and burst into flames, force said.      Armed guards on the Albacan fired shots at the skiffs and repelled the attack, it said. No crew members were injured, and the small fire was extinguished.      The EU mission tries to deter and stop piracy off Somalia, which has been mired in chaos since the early 1990s. It escorts vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean carrying World Food Program humanitarian aid to displaced people in Somalia.      It also seeks to protect \"vulnerable vessels\" in the Gulf of Aden and off the Somali coast, according to the mission's Web site."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/0753a471e6908c35bcbc2daa37e21f3a8443b590.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What sum do patients pay for a new kidney?", "id": "107881", "answers": [{"text": "$30,000", "answer_start": 1583}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "HONG KONG, China (Reuters) -- Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner; Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $5,300; in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys.  Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys.  They are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life.  Lee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread.  A friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place. That April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life.  \"The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons,\" Lee told Reuters. \"Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang. I thank the donor deeply.\"  The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000.  Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and \"transplant tourists\" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living.  A donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade.  But even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests.  And the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient. Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver.  The complications can include bleeding, infection, even death.  In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk.  \"It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you don't have to care for someone you don't know. Once you pay, it is discarded in a way, it is dispensable,\" said Luc Noel, a Geneva-based coordinator for Clinical Procedures at the World Health Organization.  China recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners, saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year.  Only 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year. Of these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors.  China defended its use of organs from executed prisoners, saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families. A transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $33,000 in China.  \"What is important is the transparency, it has to be open to scrutiny ... if China makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent, that would do good,\" said the WHO's Noel.  In Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs.  Excluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year, said Lo Chung-man, professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the University of Hong Kong.  Pakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a \"kidney bazaar\", said the chief executive of Pakistan's Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi.  There are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but Naqvi said there were 13 centers in Lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys.  Patients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees ($8,500) for a new kidney, he said. Donors are paid $300 to $1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery.  There is no consent in some cases. In May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations.  In the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade, but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative, with no payment. Such a clause allowing \"altruistic\" organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said.  Stories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt, where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line.  Karam, who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal, said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure. He said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,300).  \"The fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds. Both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the 'donor' received,\" said Karam.  He said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients' lists.  Abdel-Kader Hegazy, head of the disciplinary committee at the Doctors' Union, said Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence.  \"The law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment. We at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices, but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back,\" he told Reuters.  \"It is an annoying and a regrettable situation. Well-known doctors and professors are doing this. They are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values.\"  The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants, with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities.  But the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders on whether Islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths.  In Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys, listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type.  These would-be donors say they have had enquiries from Germany, Israel and Turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira ($38,760).  Hakan, a 27-year-old security guard in Istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published, told Reuters he received five or six offers from Turkey and Germany, offering 10,000-15,000 lira ($11,600), but he's holding out for 40,000 lira.  \"Of course it's frightening but there's nothing else to be done,\" he said, adding he hadn't told his wife as he knew she would object.  \"I'm doing it because of my family, if I was alone it wouldn't matter. I've got two children ... there's nothing else I can do for them.\" E-mail to a friend"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/44729f5ff58648385ab0713829223900338ada70.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what was student attempting to accomplish", "id": "107884", "answers": [{"text": "intent to terrorize", "answer_start": 1690}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The University of California San Diego has suspended a student who admitted to hanging a noose in a campus library, school officials announced Friday.      \"We are feeling real pain, and we will take real action,\" said UCSD chancellor Marye Anne Fox told reporters. \"The safety of our students, faculty, and staff is my primary concern.\"      The student, whose identity was not released, admitted Friday to police at the University of California San Diego that she hung a noose Thursday night in the library, police said.      \"Detectives have interviewed the student and taken a statement,\" UCSD police said in a release. \"The investigation is ongoing as we continue to identify and interview witnesses.\"      After Thursday's discovery, hundreds of people joined a campus rally to oppose racial intolerance. \"It's OK to feel hurt and angry about this,\" said one participant. \"We've been silent for too long.\"      Watch iReport of campus protest      One student said she feared for her safety.

The firefighters were among the New Haven 20 -- one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters -- who fought the city after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam that left too few minorities qualified for promotions.    A U.S. District Court issued a judgment finding the city violated the civil rights of a group of the white firefighters when it threw out the exams in 2004, according to Jessica Mayorga, city spokeswoman. The Tuesday decision follows a court action by seven black New Haven firefighters seeking to delay the promotions.    \"Yesterday, the court entered an order that provides the City of New Haven with the legal sanction necessary to move forward and promote the fourteen plaintiffs in the Ricci case entitled to promotions,\" the city said in a statement. \"As a result, we intend to do so as soon as practicable.\"    The firefighters will be promoted to either lieutenant or captain.    Mayorga said the other six involved in the lawsuit were not eligible for promotions that were available at the time the exams were given. She said the court's order only addresses 14 of the 20 plaintiffs. If the exams had been certified in 2004, the other six plaintiffs would not have been promoted.    The case was the center of attention during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of now-Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that backed the city in the case. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually overturned the appeals court ruling 5-4 earlier this year when the justices ruled that the city improperly threw out the results of the promotion exams.    Key plaintiff Frank Ricci and others took promotion exams in 2003 for lieutenant and captain positions that had become available in Connecticut's second-largest city.    New Haven's personnel department had contracted with a private firm to design the exams.    When the results came back, however, city lawyers expressed concern about the results because none of the black firefighters and only one Latino who took the exam scored high enough to be promoted.    The city said that under a federal civil rights law known as Title VII, employers must ban actions such as promotion tests that would have a \"disparate impact\" on a protected class, such as a specified race or gender. The group of firefighters, claiming they were wronged by the city's action, then sued, calling themselves the \"New Haven 20.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/1576bd646278ec005c269934262b0ad51328fc81.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What says Official?", "id": "107895", "answers": [{"text": "Internet to smear a foreign service officer", "answer_start": 1015}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- A videotape on a Russian Web site allegedly showing a State Department employee having sex with a prostitute is a \"smear campaign\" meant to discredit the man, a State Department spokesman said Thursday.    The State Department has said the tape allegedly showing an employee having sex with a prostitute is a fake.    The employee, Brendan Kyle Hatcher, denied any encounter with a prostitute to his superiors at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, another State Department official said.

The tape then appeared on the tabloid newspaper Web site Compromat.ru and was picked up by other outlets. Diplomatic sources who declined to be named said Compromat.ru has a history of ties to Russia's security services.    Russia's Foreign Ministry had no comment when asked about the video.    Another senior State Department official, who has seen the video, said \"it's clear to me that it's him,\" referring to portions showing Hatcher alone in the hotel room.    \"But then the lights go down,\" and the footage from there on is faked, that official said.    The video of Hatcher in the hotel room was taken last year, \"somewhere in Siberia,\" said the senior State Department official who watched the video.    It was shot in a hotel that Hatcher visited, the official said.    When questioned about the possible motivation for creating the video, the official said it's presumed \"it was done because of his human rights work,\" in Russia.    The official doubted the incident will have any effect on U.S.-Russian relations and noted that the Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry have both been \"very cooperative\" in the months since the footage came to light.    \"The vast majority of people there are working toward better relations,\" the official said.    Another official said Hatcher is a \"great officer\" who, until last summer, was a political reporting officer focusing on religious freedom issues in Russia. The assignment lasts two years: one year in that specialty and a year on the visa-issuing line at the embassy.    Last year, this official said, Hatcher was the lead officer compiling the State Department's Religious Freedom report and was given an award for his work by the ambassador.    Another official confirmed that Hatcher received a meritorious honor award in 2009 and a group award in 2008.    Hatcher, one official said, worked with religious groups that are considered \"outside the mainstream\" in Russia, such as Protestants and non-Christians. Such faiths often face official and unofficial discrimination in the largely Russian-Orthodox society.    Another senior State Department official said, \"there is a lot of inertia\" among some special security services in Russia.    \"They are pretty much unreconstructed,\" he said. The security services may have wanted to compromise Hatcher's ability to work with religious groups, he says, \"or they may have wanted to throw a stick into the spokes\" of the U.S.-Russia relationship.    \"Some in Moscow,\" he said, \"are looking to integrate with the West, and others are trying to stop that.\"    The officials asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

Kennedy saw a proposed ban on above-ground nuclear tests as a way to thaw U.S.-Soviet relations after the Cuban Missile Crisis, according to recordings released Thursday.  President John F. Kennedy expresses a desire to thaw U.S.-Soviet relatations, on newly released recordings.  \"If it does represent a possibility of avoiding the kind of collision that we had last fall in Cuba, which was quite close, and Berlin in 1961, we should seize the chance,\" Kennedy said in a July 1963 meeting with top government scientists.

Kennedy's presidential library in Boston, Massachusetts, released the four-minute recording of the meeting, held just four months before his assassination. The scientists taking part included John Foster and Norris Bradbury, the directors of two of the top U.S. nuclear laboratories; Glenn Seaborg, then-head of the Atomic Energy Commission; and a member of the commission, John Palfrey.

The recent spate of violence was sparked by the arrest of high-ranking drug cartel member Arnoldo Rueda Medina.    The federal officers' bodies were found Tuesday on a remote highway in Michoacan state, where at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers have been killed since July 11 due to drug-related violence.

The governor has publicly urged his brother to surrender. There were no reports of his apprehension as of late Saturday.    The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest July 11 of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, described as a high-ranking member of La Familia.    La Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said. When that failed, cartel members attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities.

Darren Tuck turned himself in to authorities Sunday. He earlier gave police the tape of the girl.    Tuck had recently given police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, Sheriff Tony De Meo said.    Police said he had the tape for at least five months before turning it in.    He was being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who have said they want to question him further -- had been unable to locate him.    Tuck, of Nevada, allegedly showed the tape to others, and faces between 10 years to life in prison for exhibiting pornography and one to six years for possession of child pornography, said De Meo.    Tuck's attorney Harry Kuehn said last week on CNN's \"Nancy Grace\" that Tuck had been \"wracked by indecision\" as to what to do with the tape once he realized what it was.    \"You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had,\" the attorney said. \"He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory.\"    The four-year-old videotape shows the 3-year-old girl being raped in Las Vegas, Nevada. Last week, she was found safe.    Now seven, the girl was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in to police, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture.    CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, and De Meo asked media to stop showing the picture.    \"The mother has cooperated with us,\" De Meo said. \"We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl. It was very sad for her to find this out.\"    Authorities have identified Chester A. Stiles, 37, as the suspect in the tape. A  resident of Pahrump, Nevada, he remains at-large, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas.    Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said.    Someone close to Stiles told investigators Stiles is a \"survivalist type\" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said.    Todd Allen, a Las Vegas resident, told CNN he once lived with the girl from the video and her mother. He said he recognizes his old apartment from scenes in the video. He said he knows the suspect because Allen's mother dated Stiles and the couple spent time together at Allen's apartment.  Watch Allen describe Stiles and the girl \u00bb    Allen said nobody realized the child had been abused.    \"She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like,\" he said. \"You would never know something like that happened. Ever.\"    Allen said he never witnessed Stiles physically assault anyone.    \"But I have seen him verbally and mentally assault many people,\" Allen told CNN. \"He's good with mind games. He's good at twisting people's realities and manipulating people.\"    De Meo addressed Stiles directly on Saturday: \"Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency,\" he said. \"Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency.\"    The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said.

Courtney Larrell Lockhart, 23, of Smiths, Alabama, is charged with capital murder during a kidnapping, capital murder during a robbery, and capital murder during an attempted rape, Tommy Dawson said Saturday.    The Phenix City Police Department took Lockhart into custody on Friday, police said. Phenix City is about 35 miles southeast of Auburn.    Burk, 18, from Marietta, Georgia, was found shot on North College Street, a few miles north of campus, on Tuesday night. She died later at a hospital.    Minutes after police responded to the call reporting an injured person and found Burk, they found a car -- which turned out to be Burk's -- on fire in a campus parking lot.    Dawson told reporters Friday that authorities think gasoline or another accelerant was used to ignite Burk's car, and police were investigating whether a gas can found in downtown Auburn was connected. Police want to investigate every possible lead, Dawson said.    Authorities were still on patrol in the east Alabama campus, he said.    The university's Web site said a campus-wide memorial service will be held Monday.    The site carried a message from Burk's father, James, which said: \"The Burk family was so proud to have Lauren as an Auburn University student. We want to extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation for Auburn University, the city of Auburn and the Auburn Police Department. We feel very close to your community. We appreciate what everyone is doing for us and Lauren.\"    Also on Friday, police released pictures of a 2001 Honda Civic similar to Burk's car. Authorities asked anyone who thinks they might have seen the car on Tuesday to contact them.    Police are continuing to interview people, Dawson said.    A student at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill -- Eve Carson, 22, of Athens, Georgia -- was also shot to death this week, on early Wednesday.

The presidential handshake between Barack Obama and Hugo Chavez spurred many comments.      But just for the record, let's not forget that President George W. Bush kissed and held hands with the same Abdullah after 9/11, while also looking deep into the soul of Vladimir Putin. And a generation earlier, egged on by British Prime Minister \"Iron Lady\" Margaret Thatcher, President \"Tear Down That Wall\" Ronald Reagan, decided that indeed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was a man he could do business with: the business of ending the Cold War.      While Obama has not managed in 100 days to defeat Islamic militants, usher in a Middle East peace treaty or disarm North Korea, on these and other issues he has laid down some important groundwork. Most importantly, the global polls following his first overseas trip show he has begun restoring America's name and reputation, key ingredients to successful policy making.      Even before stepping onto foreign soil, Obama began by ordering the infamous Guantanamo Bay detention center closed, thus returning the United States to upholding the very same rule of law it preaches to other nations. He also has  stated over and over again that \"America does not torture,\" thus returning the United States to leading on human rights, not cherry-picking them.      To those such as former Vice President Dick Cheney who claims this will make America more vulnerable, even some former Bush administration officials now concede that rigorous but patient above-board interrogation has proven to yield better, more reliable intelligence than a rush to the waterboard.      Obama has kept a campaign pledge and given a fixed date for ending the unpopular U.S. war in Iraq. \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end,\" he announced.      Yet the perils are clear. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians have been killed in Baghdad and other cities in a surge of sectarian violence since January. The Obama administration and U.S. military leaders are playing it down, blaming the suicide bombings on a few militant cells. That brings back memories of Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld blaming a \"handful of dead-enders\" as the original insurgency was getting into full swing. Much work still needs to be done to stabilize Iraq militarily and politically.      Drawing down in Iraq means surging in Afghanistan, which along with Pakistan is still viewed as the central front on terror. \"If the Afghanistan government falls to the Taliban or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged,\" Obama said in March, \"that country will again be a base for terrorists.\"      So he has ordered 21,000 new U.S. troops there by summer. But for all the talk of more boots on the ground, negotiating with moderate Taliban and beefing up Afghan security forces, danger will persist unless the Afghan people see more of a peace dividend. As Obama himself recognizes, \"There will be no lasting peace unless we expand spheres of opportunity for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"  Watch highlights from Obama's first 100 days \u00bb      Dire poverty still stalks the land and people desperate to feed their families will lay an IED for cash if they cannot farm or find a decent paying job. Although the Taliban had less than 8 percent support in Afghanistan at the end of 2007, according to an ABC poll, Afghan public opinion is turning against the U.S.-led coalition partly because of the rising number of civilian casualties as the U.S. military hunts down terrorists with airstrikes.      The same is happening in Pakistan. When unmanned drones and other airstrikes target militants but cost many civilian lives, it turns people against the United States. One month ago, President Obama unveiled an Afghan-Pakistan strategy for stabilizing the region, and yet things have gotten so much worse in the weeks since that now he, British officials and other world leaders openly fear the Talibanization of nuclear-armed Pakistan.      A furious Pakistan government accuses the United States of sowing panic among the people and insists it's in full control of its country and its nuclear arsenal. But it is hard to overdramatize the danger as this U.S. ally concedes land and appeases the Taliban, then watches as it reneges on a so-called \"peace deal\" and rolls ever closer to the capital, Islamabad. On May 6 and 7, Obama will be meeting in Washington with the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the fight to deny the militants a tipping point momentum, the military tells me 2009 will be crucial.      As for Iran, which even two years ago candidate Obama said would be directly engaged by his administration, there is nothing formal yet between the two sides.      After 30 years of enmity, President Obama offered Iran \"the promise of a new beginning\" in a Persian New Year video message, and since then has clearly signaled the United States was over regime-change. The Iranian government and leadership have responded in kind, saying they are ready to engage with America if the administration is really committed to changing its Iran policy.      However, much of this good will has been over the airwaves and direct or back-channel talks have yet to start. Into this vacuum are stepping all the sundry pro- and anti-Iran interest groups, experts, analysts and nations, with their often-conflicting advice and sometimes confused understanding. Yet it is widely acknowledged that a strategic realignment with Iran would benefit U.S. and regional security and stability.      The new Israeli government wants to see no such thing, and wants people to believe it will bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, a belief it fosters with background briefings to journalists in the United States and presumably elsewhere. In an ironic twist, Israel's Arab neighbors are bringing their dire warnings about Iran to the White House.      Meantime, Obama has named a new Middle East Peace envoy, former Sen. George Mitchell, signaling he wants to take negotiations out of the deep freeze and committing to the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. Trouble is new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not signed on to the two-state solution and is trying to fend off this pressure, even suggesting Israel won't engage with the Palestinians until the United States takes care of Iran.      Last week, Obama told Jordan's King Hussein at the White House, \"My hope would be that over the next several months you start seeing gestures of good faith on all sides.\" He added, \"We can't talk forever; at some point, steps have to be taken so that people can see progress on the ground.\" The president has invited the leaders of Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to the White House in coming weeks. iReport.com: Grade Obama's first 100 days      The second hundred days in foreign policy will be filled with mini-summits at the White House and major summits abroad -- Russia in July and China sometime later.      With all this activity, Obama is clearly shifting the United States away from the \"isolate and punish\" policy of his predecessor. He is signaling that clearheaded meetings to discuss issues of mutual concern are better than hiding your head in the sand and hoping they'll go away.

The 1-ton creature is believed to have been about 3 meters in length and 1.5 meters tall.    The fossilized skull of the new giant rodent    The giant rat's skull, which measures an impressive 53 centimeters in diameter was found by Andr\u00e9s Rinderknecht and Ernesto Blanco, two scientists from Montevideo, Uruguay.    The two paleontologists stumbled upon the fossilized remains in a broken boulder in San Jose along the coast of Uruguay.    By looking at the size ratios of the skulls and bodies of existing rodents, scientists determined the bodyweight of the rodent must have approached 1,000 kilograms or a ton, making it the world's largest rodent to have been discovered to date.    The relatively small size of its teeth however, suggests it fed mainly upon soft vegetables and fruit.    \"We can give an educated guess that the rodent would have been 3 meters long -- assuming that it was similar to a Capybara (the largest rodent alive today) and taking it into account that large mammals generally have relatively smaller heads. It's tail probably was closer to the one of capybara or guinea pig (very short) and not like a rat,\" Ernesto Blanco says.    The scientists believe the rodent, named Josephoartigasia monesi, roamed the earth about four million years ago at the same time as other giant creatures, such as terror birds, saber-toothed cats, ground sloths and giant armored mammals.    During this period, the now arid region was forested and rich in vegetation. The largest living rodent is the capybara, a 50 kilogram guinea pig found in South America.

Richard Shelby says.    \"Everybody on the street in America understands that,\" said Sen. Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. \"This is not the right road to go. We'll pay dearly.\"    Shelby, of Alabama, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the package and efforts to shore up the struggling banking system will put the United States on \"a road to financial disaster.\"    But Lawrence Summers, the head of the administration's National Economic Council, said Republicans have lost their credibility on the issue.  Watch Republicans criticize the stimulus bill \u00bb    \"Those who presided over the last eight years -- the eight years that brought us to the point where we inherit trillions of dollars of deficit, an economy that's collapsing more rapidly than at any time in the last 50 years -- don't seem to me in a strong position to lecture about the lessons of history,\" Summers told ABC's \"This Week.\"    President Barack Obama, his advisers and the Democratic leaders of Congress argue the roughly $830 billion measure will help pull the U.S. economy out of its current skid. Much of the package involves infrastructure spending, long-term energy projects and aid to cash-strapped state and local governments.    The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported last week that the measure is likely to create between 1.3 million and 3.9 million jobs by the end of 2010, lowering a projected unemployment rate of 8.7 percent by up to 2.1 percentage points.    But the CBO warned the long-term effect of that much government spending over the next decade could \"crowd out\" private investment, lowering long-term economic growth forecasts by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent by 2019.    In a concession to Republicans, about a third of the bill involves tax cuts. But the measure is expected to have only minimal GOP support when it goes to a scheduled vote early this week.  Watch South Carolina Gov.

But this is not it,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, last year's GOP presidential nominee.    Senators reached a tentative agreement Friday on a compromise bill largely negotiated by a handful of moderate Republicans whose votes are needed to prevent a filibuster. But McCain told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the package should have been about half the size of the one now before senators, and should be balanced between tax cuts and spending.    \"We're going to amass the largest debt in the history of this country, by any measurement, and we're going to ask our kids and grandkids to pay for it,\" he said.    The stimulus bill includes about $45 billion in transportation spending, much of which can be spent on projects \"that can be implemented immediately,\" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told CNN. LaHood, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, said he would talk to his former colleagues on Capitol Hill \"and do all that I can to persuade them that this bill really will put people to work.\"    He said he invited state transportation chiefs to Washington for a Wednesday meeting on how to create jobs using funding from the stimulus bill.    \"There aren't going to be any boondoggles. This money will be spent correctly, by the book, with no shortcuts,\" LaHood said.    The administration is also readying a second phase of the financial bailout program launched by the Bush administration last fall.    Shelby said Obama and his advisers need to address the staggering problems in the U.S. banking system first.    \"Until we straighten out our banking system, until there is trust in our banking system, until there's investment there, this economy is going to continue to tank,\" he said.    Shelby also has been critical of other efforts by the federal government to help the struggling economy, including legislation that would have provided a bailout to the auto industry.    But Sen. Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, told CBS the current recession -- which has already produced an unemployment rate of 7.6 percent -- is in danger of a deep downturn \"like we saw in the Great Depression.\"    \"If there is a failure to give a significant boost to this economy, this crisis will only deepen and become far more serious,\" said Conrad, D-North Dakota."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9510b46d8d4617706373aa5b4fa9b480e7c9d274.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What Kelly Osbourne says?", "id": "107915", "answers": [{"text": "\"I took more hell for being fat than I did for being an absolute raging drug addict.

Moazzam Begg says that during intense interrogations at Guantanamo Bay, he would have confessed to anything.  Justice will be impossible to mete out to the alleged terrorists and war criminals held there because any confessions must be tainted by the methods used to obtain them, ex-prisoner Moazzam Begg told CNN.  Begg says he would have confessed to anything during interrogations while he was held at Guantanamo for nearly three years.  \"What procedure can you use on people who have been systematically tortured including waterboarding, including being stripped naked and beaten? What sort of evidence can be admitted into a court of law that has been extracted under that process?\" asked Begg.  Watch what Begg thinks of Guantanamo \u00bb  The new administration  has said that waterboarding, which causes the feeling of drowning, is torture.  Begg, who is British, was captured during the war in Afghanistan and accused of aiding the Taliban regime.  His family has always maintained he was a victim of mistaken identity. He was sent back to his home in Britain by the Bush administration in 2005 and never prosecuted.  President Obama on Wednesday moved closer to making good on his campaign promise. The administration is drafting executive orders calling for the detention facility's closure, officials said. Earlier in the day, a judge granted Obama's request for a 120-day suspension of prosecutions so a review of all cases of suspected terrorists could take place.  During his inaugural speech, he stressed that ideals of justice did not need to be thrown out to ensure the nation's safety.  \"Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake,\" Obama said.  Watch what could be next for Guantanamo \u00bb  Legal issues are already complicating the cases of some of the most important terror suspects, like Mohamed al-Qahtani, the so-called 20th hijacker, who has been accused of helping to plan and possibly participate in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  Earlier this month, the retired judge in charge of determining which Guantanamo detainees should be tried by a U.S. military commission told The Washington Post that al-Qahtani was tortured and therefore could not  be put forward for prosecution.  \"Guantanamo Bay is the most notorious prison on earth,\" Begg said. He said he believes Guantanamo is a radicalizing force for militants around the world.  Looking beyond high-profile suspects, human rights campaigners say there is little evidence to prosecute dozens of Guantanamo inmates still being held. They argue that keeping those detainees locked up will not help keep al Qaeda at bay.  \"I think it's actually one of the most harmful myths about it, that we can't let people go because we've got the tiger by the tail,\" said Cori Crider of the human rights organization Reprieve.  Chris Arendt, a former guard at Guantanamo Bay, says the Obama administration must rethink and reform the way it detains and prosecutes future terror suspects -- and do more than just close Guantanamo.  \"We're focused on this one camp that has become the star of the whole show. But there are camps everywhere,\" he said.  \"There are camps in Iraq, in Afghanistan -- every country that American or the coalition forces have set their feet.

Dr. Conrad Murray was with Michael Jackson on the day that he died.    The warrants, signed by District Judge Timothy Williams and given to CNN by Las Vegas affiliate KTNV, say \"there is probable cause to believe\" that searches would uncover evidence at the Las Vegas home and office of Dr. Conrad Murray of excessive prescribing, prescribing to an addict, excess treatment or prescribing, unprofessional conduct, prescribing to or treating an addict and manslaughter.    They cite \"probable cause to believe\" that the premises contained \"records, shipping orders, distribution lists, use records relating to the purchase, transfer ordering, delivery and storage of propofol (Diprivan).\"    A source told CNN on Monday that the Texas-based cardiologist allegedly gave Jackson the anesthetic propofol -- commonly known by the brand name Diprivan -- in the 24 hours before he died.    A source involved in the investigation into Jackson's death has told CNN that investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in his $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills, California.  Watch report on the warrants \u00bb    The items taken from Murray's home included copies of his computer and cell phone hard drives. They were to be turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department, which is leading the investigation into Jackson's death last month at age 50.    Murray is the central focus of a federal investigation into the singer's death, a law enforcement official told CNN on Wednesday.    Authorities have subpoenaed the records of various doctors who have treated Jackson over the years, but \"Dr. [Conrad] Murray is the only one we're looking at,\" the federal law enforcement official said.    The disclosures were among several developments Wednesday in a story that continues to gather steam more than a month after the death of the pop icon on June 25.    Other recent developments:    \u2022 Jackson's father, Joe, acknowledged that a 25-year-old Norwegian performer is Jackson's son -- even as the man himself denied the relationship in various news reports.    \u2022 Jackson's estate is worth at least $200 million, a source with knowledge of the estate's dealings told CNN.    Murray and the drug investigation    Despite the comment from the federal law enforcement official, Murray's lawyer does not think an arrest is imminent because autopsy results into Jackson's death are pending.    Police have interviewed Murray twice since Jackson's death. Murray's lawyer, Ed Chernoff, said his client is ready to talk to investigators again, but a meeting has not been scheduled.    Murray has consistently denied he prescribed or administered anything that could have killed Jackson.  Watch a profile of Murray \u00bb    On Tuesday, investigators searched Murray's home and office in Las Vegas, Nevada.    Chernoff said he won't comment on \"rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources.\"  Watch CNN's Ted Rowlands report on drug allegation \u00bb    Meanwhile, Murray failed to make a payment of $15,000 on his $1.65 million home in January and has racked up debt since.    If he does not make a payment by mid-August, he will lose his home to foreclosure, a spokeswoman confirmed.    \"He was to be paid $150,000 a month by Michael Jackson,\" the spokeswoman said. \"He was not [paid] by AEG, the tour promoter, or Jackson, for the two months he worked for them. So he's low on money.\"    Murray has been beset by financial difficulties since graduating from medical school.    He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1992 and accumulated $44,663 in state tax liens in Arizona and California from 1993 until 2003, according to court documents.    He has also has been hit with several judgments related to unpaid bills, child support payments and defaults on education loans.    On Wednesday, CNN learned Murray was arrested on a charge of domestic violence disorderly conduct in Tucson, Arizona, in 1994.    Murray's then-girlfriend accused him of having an affair and threw something at him, Tucson law enforcement officials said. Murray allegedly pushed the woman down.    The doctor was acquitted five months after the incident.    Joe Jackson: Jackson had another son    In an interview with the Web site NewsOne, Jackson's father, Joe, said the singer had another son, a 25-year-old Norwegian performer, Omer Bhatti.    \"Yes, I knew he had another son. Yes, I did,\" Joe Jackson said. \"He looks like a Jackson, he acts like a Jackson, he can dance like a Jackson. This boy is a fantastic dancer. As a matter of fact, he teaches dancing.\"    At Jackson's memorial service this month, Bhatti was seated in the front row between the pop star's father and sister.    CNN has been unable to confirm the relationship. And Bhatti has told various media outlets that he and Jackson were close friends.    Battle brews over Jackson's will    Jackson's estate is worth at least $200 million and could amount to much more, an informed source told CNN on Wednesday.    Earlier this month, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge granted control of Jackson's assets to the executors of his will: John Branca, Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend.    A third executor, accountant Barry Siegel, recused himself. Jackson's mother, Katherine, now wants the judge to install her in the open slot.    The judge has scheduled a hearing on Monday.    \"The question is, will all this get resolved on Monday, when there is a hearing?\" said CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom. \"Or will this blow up into a huge dispute between Katherine and the executors?\"    CNN's Randi Kaye and Ted Rowlands contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/5ac5fb3ab6f87c9974952342919a51ac33a319ad.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did the military refuse to do?", "id": "107918", "answers": [{"text": "stop recruiting", "answer_start": 646}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's government ordered the country's army chief of staff fired Sunday, touching off street protests and a split in Nepal's Maoist-dominated ruling coalition.    General Rookmangud Katawal gestures after inspecting the guard of honour in New Delhi on December 12, 2007.    But Gen. Rookmangud Katawal has refused to accept his dismissal, and Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav -- the constitutional commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces -- has told Katawal to remain in office, a presidential spokesman said.    Nepal's Cabinet voted to dismiss Katawal after the military refused the government's order to stop recruiting about 3,000 new soldiers to fill vacant positions when it has yet to take in former Maoist rebels, as a 2006 peace deal required.    The move prompted the Maoists' largest coalition partner to quit the government, the party's leader said.    \"Without consensus, the ongoing peace process will not reach its logical conclusion and the drafting of the new constitution will not be possible,\" said Ishwor Pokharel, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). \"The consensus that existed so far has come to standstill.\"    Supporters of both sides in the dispute took to the streets for demonstrations Sunday. Despite sporadic clashes between the two factions, there were no serious injuries reported.    The Maoists laid down their arms and won power in 2008 elections after an agreement that ended a decade-long insurgency. Under the deal, more than 19,000 former insurgents were to be integrated into the country's security forces.    But two weeks ago, the government asked Katawal to explain why he went to the Supreme Court to challenge the government's refusal to extend the tenure of eight brigadier generals in March. Government spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said Sunday that the government was not satisfied with Katawal's explanation and fired him -- three months before his scheduled retirement -- in a meeting that the Maoists' coalition partners boycotted.    Pokharel said his party urged the Maoists not to fire Katawal without a consensus in the country's parliament. He said the Maoists, led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, ignored that advice.    \"We do not like the way the Maoists' way of functioning,\" Pokharel said.    The Maoists hold 238 of the 601 seats in parliament, while Pokharel's party has 109. The Maoists could continue to hold power with the support of smaller parties, but Pokharel said his party is working to form a new ruling coalition.    The Cabinet named an interim army chief, but presidential spokesman Rajendra Dahal told CNN that 18 parties in Nepal's parliament asked Yadav to keep Katawal on the job. There was no immediate reaction from the government on the president's decision."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/12e6c95b6f47092e953523ae556cb6391a7021f6.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what is difficult in haiti", "id": "107924", "answers": [{"text": "Amputations", "answer_start": 927}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Haiti's earthquake is creating \"a generation of amputees,\" something that will pose a challenge for Haitian society for years to come, experts say.      The 7.0 earthquake resulted in thousands having their limbs crushed as Haiti's ramshackle buildings fell on top of them.      The number of amputees created by the disaster is hard to measure, but Handicap International estimates it is at least 2,000 and growing. Dr. Mitra Roses of the Pan American Health Organization said some hospitals were performing between 30 and 100 amputations a day after the earthquake.      At one small hospital in the capital that is now functioning under a tent, doctors say they are performing more and more amputations on children.      \"We're having a generation of amputees,\" said one medical worker. She had just discovered that a 2-year-old girl cannot feel her left foot and may need an amputation. \"It's heartbreaking.\"      Amputations in Haiti are especially difficult for patients because so many people get around on foot or by bicycle. Sidewalks and roads are poor and wheelchairs, crutches and canes are few.      \"What I fear is that if I can't walk, I can't go to school and I can't go to church,\" said a boy who lost his foot in the earthquake. Without his foot, he said, he can't pedal the bike he normally takes to church and to school.      \"It's not an environment which is conducive to mobility for people who are not able to walk for a variety of reasons,\" Stephanie Stuart, director of Handicap International UK, told CNN.      Amputees may have trouble getting to work, she said, and the problem is compounded if those people perform manual labor, which requires greater use of their limbs.      \"Their circumstances are pretty dire, because an amputee in Haiti is highly disadvantaged in terms of being able to be mobile, have a job and look after family,\" said Eric Doubt, executive director of Healing Hands for Haiti International, which provides treatment and rehabilitation to people with disabilities.      Young amputees face different issues, said Stuart. Like the boy who lost his foot, they may not be able to go to school, putting them at risk of losing education.      They also can't play with their friends or enjoy the activities they used to, and they may be too young to understand why, Stuart said.      Even if those children make it to school, they may have trouble adapting to an able-bodied environment.      \"A lot of children, if they couldn't manage to go to the loo (toilet) in schools, would they feel they wanted to spend the day there?\" Stuart said.      Parents of children with lost limbs may also find it hard to adapt, she said.      \"However much they love them, are (parents) still going to be able to support them and help their education and well-being as much as they could with an able child?\"      The Pan American Health Organization said disabilities can cause significant and long-term economic and mental health problems for earthquake survivors.      With so many earthquake victims having had or facing the prospect of amputations, Haiti's government should prioritize the issue of disability and support for disabled people, Stuart said.      Before the earthquake, Haiti had only one facility that produced prosthetic limbs. It survived the earthquake but will not be able to meet current needs, Doubt said.      \"They actually are able to start fabricating but ... they're very small, and the need is much greater,\" Doubt told CNN by phone from the organization's offices in Georgetown, Ontario. Even before the earthquake, he said, \"we were only really touching the need at the time.\"      There were about 800,000 Haitians with handicaps and disabilities before the earthquake, Doubt said.      \"Handicapped in Haiti have been largely unattended to or abandoned by their governments, and there are very few medical organizations who attend to them or provide a focus on them, so it was a very large job to begin with,\" he said. \"There are going to be many more disabled (now), and among them a large population of newly amputated patients, and that population is going to grow.\"      Stuart explained that many people with injuries requiring amputation may not have made it yet to hospitals. Others may simply have skin wounds, but if they can't get to a hospital and their wounds become infected, it could necessitate amputation.      Anticipating the need, the group Physicians for Peace has begun to collect prosthetics, crutches, canes, walkers and wheelchairs. Amputees are typically fitted with new limbs after two to four months of healing.      Used prosthetics will be particularly beneficial in Haiti, where manufacturing artificial limbs is likely to be difficult, said Heather Mills, a U.N. Association goodwill ambassador.      \"What I'm trying to do is appeal to people to ... contact Physicians for Peace and take back any limbs that they're not using,\" Mills told CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" \"We can reuse the components.\"      Mills, who was once married to Beatle Paul McCartney, lost part of her left leg in a 1993 vehicle crash. She has since been active in charities to clear land mines and provide artificial limbs to tens of thousands of people.      \"I'm fully aware that they're not going to need the limbs for weeks, but it takes weeks to coordinate,\" Mills said. \"It takes weeks for people to donate. It takes weeks to get them packed and shipped.\"      Handicap International plans to produce between 300 and 400 emergency  prostheses in the next six months to cover the need until patients can receive more permanent ones, the group said.      Physicians for Peace plans to set up a prosthesis production facility in Haiti, according to the group's Web site.      \"We will work with our partners to identify whether we can use existing structures or somehow build temporary work space and bring in the specialized equipment needed to prepare and fit prosthetic devices: ovens, routers, vacuum pumps, drills, sanders and saws, as well as generators and lights,\" the Website said.      Refurbished prosthetic limbs and mobility devices collected by the group will also be shipped to Haiti.      Handicap International is also expanding its staff to around 100, and they will train local prosthetic technicians to meet the needs of amputees in the long term, Stuart said.      \"Prosthetics need to be fitted -- they're not off the shelf -- so you need technicians there,\" Stuart said. Prosthetics \"need to be changed if the child is growing, if the person gains weight, loses weight.\"      CNN's Ed Payne in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/43ba8c49ed06c4732f3c67be1dcce1303c947eed.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was the phrase \"Yes We Can\" changed to?", "id": "107926", "answers": [{"text": "Washington can.\"", "answer_start": 4653}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Whose message is Alex talking about?", "id": "108574", "answers": [{"text": "Barack Obama's", "answer_start": 446}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Editor's Note: Republican strategist Alex Castellanos was a former campaign consultant for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and has worked on more than half a dozen presidential campaigns. Castellanos is a partner in National Media Inc., a political and public affairs consulting firm that specializes in advertising. He has produced many Republican political ads and has clients such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.    Alex Castellanos says Barack Obama's change theme has buckled to \"top-down liberalism.\"    (CNN) -- In theater, they say the second act is the hardest to write. It requires relentless focus and discipline. The writer must give himself fearlessly to one central idea and never waver, though temptation is the opposite: There are many paths a story can take.    So it is in politics, as Barack Obama's campaign is learning.    The clear campaign of change ran into trouble in Act II when it was tasked with explaining what change actually meant. Obama, as they say in show business, \"ran out of script.\"    The wind in his sails stalled in the hot calm of August and he has yet to recover. After John McCain's improbable resuscitation to seize the GOP nomination, the Arizona senator's top aides briefed him about his exacting challenge: He would go into the conventions trailing Obama by at least 8 percentage points and then battle back through the fall to parity.    Yet, as cooler days and hotter rhetoric mark the start of the fall finale, it is Obama who finds himself clawing back, forced to attack, launching uncharacteristic partisan and personal attacks against a McCain who has \"lost track\" of and is \"confused\" about how many houses he owns.    How did the soaring campaign of change become grinding politics-as-usual and crash so thunderously to earth?    The Obama campaign's clear message in the primaries was a bottom-up, organic populism that cast voters themselves as the agents of change.    \"We are the change we have been waiting for,\" Obama told his supporters during the primaries. In return, they sang, \"Yes we can.\" This heady mix of populism and change swelled his campaign into a cause.    In marketing terms, it is called \"voter as hero.\" Obama empowered his supporters, telling them they, not the old political establishment, could achieve anything.    Bottom-up politics is one thing, however. Bottom-up government, another. When Barack Obama became the nominee of the national Democratic establishment, the candidate of hope ran into political reality: His party's canons of governing are the opposite of change.    Barack Obama may believe \"change doesn't come from the top down, it comes from the bottom up,\" but the leadership of his party doesn't. The national Democratic establishment, from the Daily Kos and MoveOn.org to Pelosi and Reid in Congress, still believe in top-down big-government from Washington, especially if they get to run the factory. Politically, they are industrial-age dinosaurs    They believe the era of big government is back, not over. They would keep money and power in their hands, not devolve it to the average American. That was not something the Denver Democrats were eager to confess.    Instead, they advocated a sly European-style socialism that would not speak its intent. \"Decent, quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege,\" the Democrats offered during the first night of their convention. A big-government health-care factory run by Washington? That's change? Why not the same for food, clothing and shelter?    But relax, Joe Lunchbucket, an even bigger public-sector industrial plant will impose no cost on your family. Obama's party promises not to tax you, just business -- the people who sell you your groceries and gasoline and sign your paychecks.    As Fred Thompson noted in his GOP convention speech, \"They won't take any water out of your side of the bucket. Just the other side.\" This is not \"voter as hero\" but, instead, \"voter as victim.\" A heroic Washington has all the money, the power, and the answers. Same old, same old. So the candidate of change fell silent. And he sang change never again.    Barack Obama could have spoken truth to power. He could have pledged to confront the Democratic Party establishment. He could have brought a more natural, organic era of bottom-up government, not just bottom-up politics, to a dated party clinging to a decaying philosophy of authority.    But when the irresistible force of Obama's bottom-up politics met the immovable object of Democratic Party power, it was the dream, not the power, that conceded.    \"Yes we can\" turned out to mean not \"Yes the people can\", just \"Yes Washington can.\" Too bad. It would have refreshed the Democratic Party and the country.    This movie is not new: The candidate who runs to change the establishment doesn't. Instead, we see it change him. The hope for real change in Washington has been suffocated by an older generation's embrace.    Now, Barack Obama finds himself trapped without a post-partisan message. Instead of challenging politics-as-usual, he sells the usual partisan politics: \"Bush-McCain\", he shouts from rooftops, sounding like every other Democrat in the chorus, pretending partisanship is fresh.    The story? Bottom-up change ran into top-down liberalism. Old-fashioned liberalism won. That's Act II. Stand by for the play's end.

The pinstriped jerseys, classic uniforms and ball caps of those Major League Baseball teams are timeless and have become iconic touchstones in pop culture.      It's easy to be a baseball fan if you root for teams with rich history like the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and both Chicago teams, the Cubs and White Sox.      Baseball purists must have cringed back in 1972 when the Rangers unveiled the team logo of a baseball wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat.      Calling the Rangers your team meant you truly loved baseball.      What's the power of a good luck charm?      The Yankees spent decades playing in the \"House that Babe Ruth Built\" while the Rangers spent most of my childhood playing in an uninspired location. The \"stadium\" was a converted minor-league field that looked like an open-air county arena better suited for rodeos than baseball games. But it was our Ebbets Field.      Just hours before Opening Day in 1975, a helicopter was brought in to hover over the wet field to dry out two days worth of rain. The result? The chopper crashed and gashed the field just beyond third base.      It would take another 20 years for the Texas Rangers to taste the playoffs. But the \"Curse of the Rotor Blade\" doesn't have the same mystique as the Red Sox's \"Curse of the Bambino\" or the Cubs' \"Curse of the Billy Goat.\"      The Rangers team was a collection of misfit has-beens and never-would-bes who made every kid think, \"If these guys can be ballplayers, surely I can be one, too.\"      April 12, 1991, was my chance to impress the Rangers scouts. Before the game, I was invited to play in a fly-ball catching contest. After hearing the stadium announcer call my name, I trotted out onto the hallowed grass of Arlington Stadium. A pitching machine launched the first two fly balls toward me, and with thousands of people watching, I snagged both balls.      One more catch and the entire stadium would be rewarded with a free medium soft drink from Wendy's. This is where I learned never to underestimate America's love for winning free stuff no matter how trivial it might be. The crowd came to its feet and erupted into the loudest cheers I think I've ever heard.      The machine launched a major league pop fly that seemed to take forever to come down. As I started to fall over I put my glove up and felt the ball smack the leather webbing. I got up, looked into the glove and it was still there. That was the first time I was able to scream, \"Free drinks for everyone!\" I ran off the field in glory. I still have that ball. I had all my buddies with me that day autograph it, just like real ball players do.      Chicago has its \"Lovable Losers\" in the Cubs. Rangers fans needed Lone Star beer to love its losers. Even the most fanatic baseball fan is hard-pressed to name the players who we called our own. Pete O'Brien, Larry Parrish, Oddibe McDowell, Jeff Russell, Gary Ward. Who? We watched a guy named Charlie Hough throw 50 mph knuckleballs and then puff on cigarettes in the dugout between innings.      We went to the stadium and bought $4 outfield seats. All for the privilege of watching terrible baseball in the scorching Texas heat, suffering third-degree burns from sitting on the metal bleacher seats.      In those early years, the season of hope was usually short-lived. You could count on the Rangers to be out of playoff contention by the end of May, which was fine. We had bigger things to focus on, like the Dallas Cowboys packing their bags for training camp. The losing kept the bleacher seats cheap, which was fine for most fans.      One of the best days of my life was witnessing the Rangers battle the Red Sox on April 30, 1989, on my father's birthday. I still have the ticket stub. Hall-of-Famer Nolan Ryan pitched for the Rangers, and future accused steroid user Roger Clemens pitched for the Red Sox. An epic matchup that turned out to be an epic game.      We witnessed poetic pitching. Ryan struck out 11 batters. I was in awe. Ryan and Clemens cruised but the Red Sox had a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the eighth inning. Until our favorite Cuban-exile came to the plate, Rafael Palmeiro stroked a beautiful two-run home run down the right field. The Rangers won 2-1.      Outside the stadium after the game, I got Nolan Ryan to autograph my baseball, and then I tried to get Roger Clemens' autograph and learned a valuable lesson from my dad. Clemens was intimidating. My dad patted me on the back and said, \"Don't be afraid. Go up to him and ask him for an autograph.\" With quivering hands I gave Clemens the ball. Clemens took the ball, and now I can say I'm the proud owner of Roger Clemens scribble. Most days I've spent watching Rangers baseball haven't compared to that day. But we Cubans love our baseball, and we'll take it any way we can get it.      In the early 1990s, baseball started to change. The old stadium was bulldozed and replaced with a shrine more fitting of a noble baseball team. The Rangers flirted with the playoffs three times in the late-1990s. They played 10 games and lost nine. It's the kind of angst and teasing that only Cubs and Red Sox fans can truly appreciate.      That brush with success didn't last long. The Rangers ushered in another decade of abysmal baseball that took the team to the brink of bankruptcy. That is until February 2008, when Nolan Ryan and the new ownership group rode into town and saved the day. In 2010, under Ryan's leadership, the Rangers made it to the World Series for the first time in franchise history.      SI.com: Rangers' Ron Washington: World Series hero or goat      These modern-day Rangers are a different story. The players probably aren't as fun and crazy as the misfits who sported the long-gone logo of the baseball wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat, but the team's manager, Ron Washington, is a throwback to the good old days.      Washington dances, struts, mangles the English language in a beautiful way and frantically chomps on sunflower seeds. He is a baseball genius with the heart of a 12-year-old kid cheering the team. In Ron Washington's world, \"That's the way baseball go!\"      Now the Texas Rangers are on the brink of being World Series champions. The Cardinals, Yankees, Red Sox and Cubs fans look on with envy at a franchise that spent decades as a laughingstock.      No one ever imagined we could even have a World Series parade to plan. Arlington, Texas, (where the Rangers play) has a downtown not worthy of a World Series party. But there is a Six Flags amusement park next to the stadium. Instead of a parade, I think fans should ride the roller coasters with the players. That would be a fitting way to celebrate a tear-jerking relationship full of ups and downs."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/bad69c9a3c7d84a4717705a3063dd7367243772b.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the severity of the victim's injuries?", "id": "107932", "answers": [{"text": "not life-threatening,", "answer_start": 409}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Panama City Beach, Florida, police are looking for a hotel security guard accused of raping an Alabama student and throwing her off a sixth-floor hotel balcony, a police spokesman told CNN.    Police released this photo of Shawn Wuertly, who worked as a hotel security guard in Panama City Beach, Florida.    The 18-year-old woman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, remains hospitalized, but her injuries are not life-threatening, Lt. Dave Humphreys said.    The incident happened early Monday at the Sandpiper Beacon Beach Resort in Panama City Beach during spring break.    Police have issued an arrest warrant for Shawn Wuertly, 29, who worked as a security guard at the resort, Humphreys said.    He is wanted for attempted felony murder, sexual battery and false imprisonment.    Wuertly had been questioned by police regarding the attack, but they lacked the evidence to hold him, the spokesman said.    The police investigation has found that the suspect had seen the girl \"several times\" at the hotel and had \"taken a liking to her at some point,\" Humphreys said.    Around 1 a.m. on Monday, the suspect grabbed the woman and pulled her into an unoccupied room on the sixth floor, using his key to get in, Humphreys said.    She said he sexually assaulted her and, after a brief altercation, threw her over the balcony, the police spokesman said.    She hit two smaller roofs on her way down, which likely saved her from more serious injuries, before she came to rest in a second floor stairwell, Humphreys said.

By then, the network's \"M\" could just as easily have stood for Michael. It was an event.    At a time when MTV was criticizing for not featuring black artists, Michael Jackson's success changed all that.    I can remember getting together with a group of friends to watch the premiere like it was a new movie release. The video did not disappoint. Once again Michael disregarded all conventions of the genre and not just redefined, but completely re-imagined, what a music video could be.    But most people don't know that the album broke new ground in a non-musical way, too. Viewers today of MTV, with its steady stream of reality shows like \"Real World 22 - Cancun\" and \"16 and Pregnant,\" might forget that, when it started nearly three decades ago, MTV was all music, all day.    Actually, it wasn't really all music. It was just what MTV considered rock music. By the late 1970s, radio formats had essentially resegregated the music world. When MTV launched in 1981, it modeled its playlist on the popular album-oriented rock radio format of the day, which meant that music by black artists was effectively excluded from the network. You might see the occasional Jimi Hendrix clip, but there was no room for funk, disco, R&B or that new emerging form -- rap.    It wasn't long before the public took note of the glaring absence of African-American artists. MTV was called to task on the air in 1983 for its lack of black artists by none other than David Bowie. At about the same time, MTV famously refused to air Rick James' \"Superfreak\" video. It defended itself by claiming it wasn't a rock song.    Michael Jackson changed all that.    Jackson opened the door with the video for \"Billie Jean,\" which was simply too good for its time to be overlooked. He blew that door wide open with \"Beat It,\" which featured a guitar solo by the reigning rock god of the day, Eddie Van Halen. Jackson succeeded in this not just because he was a great singer, but because of his musical daring.    \"Beat It\" was a song that was incapable of being slotted among the genres of the day. Yes, it had all the signatures of a rock song -- overdriven guitars, a driving tempo and a searing solo. But it had more. It had a backbeat. You could dance to it. You wanted to dance to it. And the viewers loved it, regardless of their race or ethnicity. iReport.com: Share stories of Jackson's success, legacy    Jackson's effect on MTV was both immediate and permanent. His videos became cultural events and his success laid waste to the notion that white rock audiences wouldn't tune in for \"black\" music. In the aftermath of Jackson's breakthrough success, MTV helped usher rap into the mainstream with shows like \"Yo! MTV Raps,\" and black artists like Prince and Chaka Khan became mainstays of the network.    It wasn't long before young people schooled on a diet that ranged from Public Enemy to AC/DC began to experiment with what those genres would sound like if they were combined -- just as Jackson had done with \"Beat It.\" The outcome was some of the most interesting music of the next decade. Artists like Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine, P.O.D. and Beck all owe a debt of gratitude to Jackson for creating a welcoming environment.    And we as fans all owe him the acknowledgment reserved for those individuals whose achievements transcend their chosen field and reshape the world around us.  Watch fans in Los Angeles react to Jackson's death \u00bb    I was always mournful about the sad spectacle his life became in recent years. But that should not detract from the meteor-like impact he had on popular culture at his peak. Michael Jackson was the Jackie Robinson of MTV. He disregarded the conventional categories of the day and created something that was both new and immediately accessible to millions of listeners.    In so doing, he forced an industry still informed by stubborn prejudices to rethink itself. Most successful entertainers can ride in tandem with the zeitgeist for only so long before they drift away. Michael Jackson did more than that. He inhabited the zeitgeist and bent it to his will. No matter where his life may have gone after that, it cannot overshadow this transcendent moment."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/ba74f7e195f6ecc56fabc280ad58dee51ce74110.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When did the researchers look at the players for the study?", "id": "107936", "answers": [{"text": "2007.", "answer_start": 2262}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "They're bigger, brawnier, and faster than the typical male, but are National Football League players healthier than other men their age?    Justin Bannan, who plays for the Baltimore Ravens, participated in the study on NFL players.    Yes and no, according to a new NFL-funded study that looks at the cardiovascular health of young athletes.    The good news is that NFL players have cholesterol levels similar to other men in their 20s and 30s, and their blood sugar tends to be even healthier. However, they are much more likely to have high blood pressure or borderline hypertension when compared with men who aren't professional athletes.    \"It's a step in the right direction to have this study,\" says Justin Bannan, 30, who plays defensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens and took part in the research. \"I think the more information we can find out and the more studies we can do, the better.\"    The study, published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is important, particularly as more and more players are weighing in at 300-plus pounds. The extra weight could potentially strain an athlete's heart in youth or even after retirement, and many question whether it has played a role in a handful of high-profile deaths. Health.com: Eat right advice: Fiber, starch, fats, serving sizes    In particular, the death of Thomas Herrion at age 23 has raised concerns about the heart health of larger players. Herrion, who was 6'3\" and 330 pounds, had just finished an exhibition game with the San Francisco 49ers when he collapsed and died in 2005.    \"He's sort of the prototype of the bigger, stronger linemen that populates the NFL now, as compared with 20 or 30 years ago,\" says lead study author Dr. Andrew M. Tucker, the team physician for the Baltimore Ravens. \"We have so many big, strong guys over 300 pounds. I think that case in particular was important in stimulating the whole study and the investigation.\"    Other heavy players-- such as defensive end Reggie White-- have also died at an early age. White was 43 when he died from cardiac arrhythmia in 2004.    In the study, Tucker, who is the cochair of the NFL subcommittee on cardiovascular health, and his colleagues looked at 504 active players from 12 teams in 2007. The researchers measured the players' height, weight, percentage of body fat, and other factors, and then compared them to 1,959 men ages 23 to 35 who participated in a study called CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults). Health.com: 20 little ways to lose drop the pounds and keep them off    They found that players were less likely to smoke or have blood-sugar problems than other men (only 6.7 percent of players had impaired fasting glucose compared to 15.5 percent of other men) and their cholesterol levels were essentially the same. However, 13.8 percent of players had high blood pressure and 64.5 percent had prehypertension, or borderline high blood pressure, compared to 5.5 percent and 24.2 percent of other men, respectively.    Tucker notes that the football players outweighed the men in the CARDIA study by an average of 70 pounds and that it's natural to assume that larger people may have higher blood pressure.    \"But what was fascinating to us was the category of prehypertension,\" says  Tucker, who is also the medical director of sports medicine at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Health.com: How to eat out without getting fat    The study found that NFL athletes are more likely to have prehypertension than other men-- regardless of the size of the player or his position.    \"So our lean players who play defensive back and wide receiver, they have prevalence of prehypertension just as common as the really big guys playing offensive and defensive line,\" says Tucker. \"So there's something that we're trying to investigate now that accounts for elevated blood pressures in our active players that is not accounted for by size alone-- there's got to be something else.\" Health.com: Cut up to 900 calories with simple substitutions    That \"something else\" could be strength or resistance training, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sleep apnea (which is characterized by heavy snoring and a hike in blood pressure), or diet, including excessive sodium intake. Dr. Tucker doesn't think anabolic steroids are to blame. Even though he and his colleagues didn't ask players if they used steroids, he says that the NFL's year-round testing program should have ruled out any use.    \"[However] I'm concerned about the widespread use of performance-enhancing agents, which contain stimulants that can not only increase blood pressure but of course have stimulating effects on the heart,\" says Dr. Tucker. He adds that, in the last several years, such stimulants have been linked to sporadic deaths in college and even professional athletes.    Although today's players are much more likely to weigh in excess of 300 pounds than those in the past, it doesn't necessarily mean they are fat, Dr. Tucker explains. Athletes are larger nowadays due to rule changes in the 1970s and 1980s that were aimed at protecting their lower bodies; those guidelines also gave larger players a competitive advantage.    If one goes by body mass index alone-- a measure of height and weight that doesn't take into account muscle mass-- more than half of players are obese, according to a 2005 study.    However, Tucker and his team found that the average percentage of body fat was 14 percent, ranging from 8 percent to 10 percent in the leaner positions-- such as wide receivers and linebackers-- to 20 percent in defensive linemen and 25 percent in offensive linemen.    \"Even our offensive linemen are really on the upper limits of what's considered healthy,\" says Tucker. \"There are plenty of my regular patients who would take that.\" Health.com: Olympic swimmer discusses life with exercise-induced asthma    Overall, Tucker says he is most worried about older, retired athletes.    \"I'm concerned about whether there is a constellation of things going on that puts them at risk when they're 45 or 55,\" he says.    More attention is being paid to detraining athletes so that they can adopt healthier lifestyles and better nutrition after they retire, says William Kraemer, Ph.D., a professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut.    \"It really is tough because you're trying to stay big in your playing days,\" says Kraemer. \"The big fear is, [after retirement] you stop exercising and you keep eating the way you used to when you were expending a lot of calories. A lot of times when kids get out of college or they get out of the pros, there is no system in place that helps them make the transition.\"    The Ravens' Bannan says the older generation is teaching younger players the importance of changing their lifestyle after retirement.    \"If you're a heavier player, a lineman that's over 300 pounds, really what it comes down to is a lifestyle change and eating healthier, losing weight when you are done, and staying active and staying healthy,\" says Bannan, who is 6'3\" and 310 pounds. \"Make a few changes in your life; I think that's going to make things a lot better for you down the road.\"    Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/fa67b52d4597e227947776fd40a4b16f402ed12d.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators set off international outrage", "id": "107937", "answers": [{"text": "demonstrations.", "answer_start": 1563}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is \"ready to cooperate\" with the government and is committed to pursuing a dialogue with the ruling junta, according to a statement the United Nations' special envoy to Myanmar read Thursday on her behalf.

On Friday Suu Kyi was able to meet with three executive members of her National League for Democracy and a party spokesman -- the first time they have met in more than three years.    Members of her party said Suu Kyi was \"very optimistic\" about prospects of the process for reconciliation, the Associated Press reported.    The Nobel Peace Prize winner has said she will continue to be \"guided by the policies and wishes\" of the opposition political party she heads -- the National League for Democracy.    In the statement, Suu Kyi also welcomed the appointment of Aung Kyi as the minister of relations, a position the junta created last month to be a liaison between government and Suu Kyi, whom the junta has under house arrest in Yangon.    She has been confined to her home for the better part of almost two decades.    Aung Kyi -- viewed as a moderate -- was appointed as the liaison officer amid international pressure following September's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations.    As many as 110 people are believed to have been killed in the violence, including 40 Buddhist monks.    Video smuggled out of the country showed unarmed protesters being beaten by the military regime's security forces, and one man -- believed to be a Japanese journalist -- was shot and killed at close range.    The protests were sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government, and quickly escalated.    Myanmar's military junta said in mid-October that it had detained more than 2,900 people during the crackdown. Many of them are still believed to be in custody.    Suu Kyi described her October 25 meeting with the liaison officer as \"constructive,\" said the statement read by Gambari. \"I look forward to further regular discussions.\"    Gambari said he will return this week to New York to brief U.N.

Madeleine McCann went missing in May 2007 after being left at a holiday apartment in the Algarve region.    Britain's Daily Telegraph and The Sun newspapers both reported Thursday that an email released this week as part of the documents compiled by the Portuguese investigators probing Madeleine's disappearance revealed the connection to the ring.    Madeleine was 3 when she disappeared May 3, 2007, while she was on holiday with her family at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. Her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide.    According to the newspapers, the email was sent on March 4 by a London-based Metropolitan Police intelligence officer to Leicestershire police -- Madeleine's home county -- who then forwarded it on to investigators in Portugal more than a month later.    In the email, which both newspapers printed a copy of, the officer writes that \"intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in Belgium made an order for a young girl three days before Madeleine McCann was taken.    \"Somebody connected to this group saw Maddie, took a photograph of her and sent it to Belgium.

On Tuesday, the documents revealed a previously undisclosed sighting of Madeleine in the Netherlands shortly after her disappearance.    The possible sighting of Madeleine in May 2007 stemmed from a report by a Dutch shopkeeper, who told authorities she encountered a little girl in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.    She said the child identified herself as Maddie and said she was taken from her mother while on holiday.    \"I start to ask where her mommy was,\" Anna Stam said. \"She couldn't tell me that. I wanted to give her a balloon, but she didn't want that. She only wants her mommy, she said. And she said that these people took her from her mommy.\"    At one point, authorities had named the girl's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, as \"arguidos,\" or suspects, along with a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. But a spokesman for the Portuguese public prosecutor's office said authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and were no longer considering them \"arguidos.\"    After closing the case, police turned their case file -- containing up to 30,000 pages -- over to attorneys and private investigators working for the McCanns.

The 100-foot Katania normally would attract an additional $49,500 charter fee for a week's use.    The 100-foot Katania was chartered by Hollywood star Hilary Swank and her husband, Chad Lowe.    Seattle, Washington-based mega-yacht rental business CEO Expeditions usually charges around $100,000 a week to charter their 100-plus-foot yachts, but they have introduced a deal waiving the charter fees -- meaning guests will only need to pay for the running of the vessel.    The move to make such vessels more affordable comes as the recession continues to put pressure on the luxury holiday and mega-yacht industries.    Although the costs of crew and luxury food aren't extremely cheap, it is expected this move will open up the recession-strained market to many more potential holiday-makers.    The Katania now costs less than $3,000 per day. Normally it would attract an additional $49,500 charter fee for a week's use.    At the $2,950-per-day special rate, four people can stay on the Katania -- but with the maximum six on board ($450 extra per person) the cost per person is a slightly better $642.    The price includes full crew, premium wines, gourmet food prepared by a private chef, amenities such as kayaks, hot tub, fishing/crabbing/shrimping equipment, and even a 30-foot whaler for guest use.    According to the company, Swank said of her charter holiday: \"We had an absolutely enchanted time aboard the Katania. A more beautiful yacht does not exist.\"    There is one small catch with the deal -- the boat is based in the San Juan islands off the coast of Washington and British Columbia, and any cruises to other destinations will attract an additional charge to cover fuel costs.    The company's owner, Bruce Milne, released a statement saying the deal was largely a result of the impact of the recession.    \"Travel is down, agents and brokers need deals, so rather than just a few full-price charters, we decided to stay busy, put more people to work, and help island tourism by doing charters at cost.    \"Since we started chartering 10 years ago, we have been looking for a chance to provide our 'Expeditions to the Extraordinary' in the San Juan Islands at a price any luxury traveler can afford -- this recession provides that opportunity,\" he said.    Tim Wiltshire, director and sales broker at international yacht company Burgess Yachts, said the charter market isn't a complete disaster, so he was surprised to see such a discount.    \"I wouldn't have expected to see that,\" he said. \"We are seeing discounts on average of about 25 percent. Although some people are trying interesting gimmicks to inspire new business.\"    Wiltshire said CEO Expedition's fleet isn't among the biggest or most luxurious on the market, and this deal appears to be clever marketing stunt.

Leslie Morgan Steiner says domestic violence afflicts the well-to-do as well as the poor.  (CNN) -- For two days, news reports called her \"the 20-year old victim\" allegedly attacked by R&B singer and dancer Chris Brown in his car early February 8 in Los Angeles, California.  We all now have good reason to believe that the alleged victim was pop singer Rihanna, Brown's girlfriend.  The story has dominated the general media with good reason. Both singers are young, apple-cheek gorgeous, immensely talented and squeaky clean -- the last couple you'd imagine as domestic violence headliners.  Perhaps the only good that will come from the Rihanna/Brown publicity is destruction of our culture's misconception that abusers and their victims can only be universally poor, uneducated and powerless.  Brown, whose first song debuted at No. 1 and whose first album topped the Billboard Hot 100, appeared on a Disney sitcom and in Sesame Street, Got Milk? and Wrigley's Doublemint Gum commercials. Barbados-born Rihanna has been big-brothered by music industry legends like Jay-Z and Kanye West and is signed to the Def Jam Recordings label.  She has been astonishingly successful in the short time she has been on the music scene, attaining five Billboard Hot 100 No. 1's with \"SOS,\" \"Umbrella,\" \"Take a Bow,\" \"Disturbia\" and T.I.'s \"Live Your Life.\"  Like Rihanna, I had a bright future in my early 20s. I met my abusive lover at 22. I'd just graduated from Harvard and had a job at Seventeen Magazine in New York.  My husband worked on Wall Street and was an Ivy League graduate as well. In our world, we were the last couple you'd imagine enmeshed in domestic violence.  Many of my ex-husband's attacks also took place in our car. For reasons I never understood, the enclosed, soundproof space brought out his worst violence. He punched me so fiercely that my face had bruises from his fist on one side and from hitting the window on the other.  As trapped in the car as I was in our marriage, it was there that I endured tirades about how controlling I was with money, how flirtatious and na\u00efve I was with other men, how defiant and disrespectful I was of my husband's authority.  So, I suppose I have more understanding than most about the shame, fury, confusion and disappointment Rihanna may be experiencing. What's hardest for outsiders to fathom is how lethal a cocktail love, hope and sympathy can be. I first fell for my husband the night he confided how he, like Chris Brown, had been traumatized as a young boy by domestic violence in his home.  \"He used to hit my mom ... He made me terrified all the time, terrified like I had to pee on myself,\" Brown said during a 2007 interview with Giant magazine.  Brown hasn't explained what happened in the recent incident, but this week he released a statement saying that he's sorry and saddened by it.  Our culture encourages women to nurture men, making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men, as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past.  In my case, it took four years, myriad terrifying attacks, and the intervention of the police and family court before I understood how little I could help my ex get over his abusive childhood.  I certainly felt alone during my abusive relationship, but unfortunately I was in good company. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that between 1 million and 3 million women in America are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend each year.  Every day, on average, three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. At some point in our lives, 25 percent of American women will report being physically abused or raped by intimate partners, according to the National Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  However, these statistics, grim as they are, fail to highlight the root of the abuse cycle. A national survey showed that 50 percent of men who frequently assault their wives also frequently abuse their children.  Witnessing abuse, as Chris Brown and my ex-husband did as young boys, is a form of abuse itself. Tragically, many victims of childhood abuse grow up to be abusers themselves. I always sensed that my husband didn't want to be hurting me -- he knew exactly how excruciating love and fear felt mixed together -- but his childhood rage overpowered his adult sensibilities.  A few months after I left my marriage, I happened across another couple in another car, late at night on an empty street. I slowed down as a well-dressed woman about 25 years old was walking away from a white Honda, brushing off a tall, handsome young man wearing a sports coat and jeans.  Suddenly she turned and tried to run. He grabbed her with his long arms and shoved her up against a dirty storefront. Even from my car I could see the fear on her pretty face.  Without thinking, I jerked my car over and got out. By this time the man had let the woman go and she'd slid behind the wheel of the car. He stepped back as I approached, his anger displaced by uncertainty and shame at being interrupted. I didn't look at him. I leaned into the car as she sat clutching the wheel, crying and staring straight ahead.  \"I just left a husband who beat me for three years,\" I said. \"You do not have to put up with this. You do not deserve to be treated like this.\"  \"I know,\" she whispered as fresh tears poured down her face. She sniffed loudly and shook her head. She wouldn't look at me. Her eyes were rimmed red, but I could see resolve in them.  \"You're right,\" she said. \"It's just taking me longer than I thought.\"  As I left, I gave the man a long stare. The spell had been broken and his face was open, sorrowful, filled with hope and fear -- a look I had seen dozens of times on my husband's face. How long would that look last before he got angry again? I could feel the woman's determination as I got back into my car. I knew she would be all right, one day. The man, I was less certain about.  Family violence is a criminal act; perpetrators, while often former victims themselves, need to accept culpability. Until we can prevent children from witnessing and becoming victims of abuse, the cycle will repeat itself: there will be many more Chris Browns and \"alleged victims\" in our headlines and in our homes.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Morgan Steiner."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a065926962ac486d89602e4e7d774f471dd692e0.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What happened to the professor?", "id": "107955", "answers": [{"text": "Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct after an exchange with the officer, who was investigating a report of a possible break-in at the house.", "answer_start": 751}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The commissioner of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, police department said Thursday he \"deeply regrets\" the arrest of prominent black Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., but stands by the procedures followed by his department.    Sgt. Jim Crowley said he has nothing to apologize for in regards to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr.    \"I believe that Sgt. [James] Crowley acted in a way that is consistent with his training at the department, and consistent with national standards of law enforcement protocol,\" Commissioner Robert Haas said, referring to the officer who made the July 16 arrest at the professor's home.    \"I do not believe his actions in any way were racially motivated,\" Haas said at a news conference.    Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct after an exchange with the officer, who was investigating a report of a possible break-in at the house.    The police department will create a panel of \"independent, notable professionals\" to provide an analysis of the incident, he said.    The controversial arrest of Gates was criticized Wednesday by President Obama, who said the Cambridge police department \"acted stupidly.\"    \"My response is that this department is deeply pained and takes its professional pride very seriously,\" Haas said.    Cambridge authorities dropped the charges against Gates on Tuesday.    In a statement, the International Association of Chiefs of Police expressed disappointment in Obama's remarks.    \"Police chiefs understand that it is critically important to have all the facts on any police matter before drawing conclusions or making any public statement,\" said Russell B. Laine, association president and chief of the Algonquin, Illinois, police department, in the statement. \"For these reasons, the IACP was disappointed in the president's characterization of the Cambridge Police Department.\"    Haas' comments followed a statement earlier Thursday from Crowley, who said he would not apologize for his actions.    \"That apology will never come from me as Jim Crowley. It won't come from me as sergeant in the Cambridge Police Department,\" Crowley told Boston radio station WEEI. \"Whatever anybody else chooses to do in the name of the city of Cambridge or the Cambridge Police Department, which are beyond my control, I don't worry about that. I know what I did was right. I have nothing to apologize for.\"    The mayor of Cambridge said she will meet with the city's police chief to make sure the scenario that led to Gates' arrest does not happen again.    \"This suggests that something happened that should not have happened,\" E. Denise Simmons, Cambridge's mayor said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"The situation is certainly unfortunate. This can't happen again in Cambridge.\"    Obama defended Gates Wednesday night, while acknowledging that he may be \"a little biased,\" because Gates is a friend.    \"But I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 ... that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.\"    The incident, Obama said, shows \"how race remains a factor in this society.\"    Crowley also said he is exercising caution and his previous actions clearly show he is not a racist.    In fact, Crowley taught a racial profiling course at the Lowell Police Academy, said Deborah Friedl, deputy superintendent of the police department.    Last year was his fifth year as a co-instructor of the course, Friedl said.    \"He seems to be a highly regarded \u00a3instructor at the academy. He consistently received high praise from students,\" she said.    Gates told CNN Wednesday that although charges had been dropped, he will keep the issue alive.    \"This is not about me; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America,\" Gates told CNN's Soledad O'Brien.    Gates said the Cambridge mayor had called him to apologize about the incident. Simmons, Cambridge's first black female mayor, confirmed to CNN that she apologized to Gates.    Gates said he'd be prepared to forgive the arresting officer \"if he told the truth\" about what the director of Harvard's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research said were \"fabrications\" in the police report. iReport.com: Join the conversation on racial profiling    Crowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him, and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, \"Why, because I'm a black man in America?\"    The report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification, but eventually produced a Harvard identification card, prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard University Police.    \"While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence, I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me,\" Crowley said, according to the report.    Gates was arrested for \"loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space\" and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station.    He said Wednesday that he and his lawyers were considering further actions, not excluding a lawsuit.    Gates said that although the ordeal had upset him, \"I would do the same thing exactly again.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9b034cd8c8d358de738070c052c4a80f68340657.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "where the shooting took place?", "id": "107956", "answers": [{"text": "Staunton ice cream store", "answer_start": 408}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- Two months before dying, a Virginia woman confessed to killing two women nearly 42 years ago, authorities said Friday, telling police she shot the women because they had taunted her for being a lesbian.  Constance Smootz Hevener, 19, was shot to death at an ice cream shop where she worked in 1967.  Sharron Diane Crawford Smith, 60, confessed in a November 28 interview to shooting the women at a Staunton ice cream store in 1967, authorities said.  \"I was just pushed so far,\" Smith said, according to a transcript of a police interview.  Smith was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Constance Smootz Hevener, 19, and Hevener's 20-year-old sister-in-law, Carolyn Hevener Perry, according to CNN affiliate WVIR.  But health problems forced a postponement of a December court date, WVIR said, and Smith, who had heart and kidney problems, died January 19.  Authorities on Friday said they consider Smith the guilty party and are working toward closing the case.  In a transcript of the police interview, Smith told police she and the women worked at High's Ice Cream. The night of the shooting, she went to the store to tell the women she could not work the next day and took her .25-caliber pistol with her.  \"I was just going to tell them that I couldn't work and one thing led to another.\"  She acknowledged that teasing \"about my lifestyle\" had gone on for a while.  Asked how the victims knew about it, she said, \"How do kids find out about anything? I mean, it was really unusual back then.\"  She also said her stepfather had sexually abused her, but refused to elaborate on whether that played a role in the shootings or helped push her \"over the edge.\"  \"I don't know. I'm not trying to psychoanalyze it,\" she said.  In other interviews with police, Smith said that she got into a physical altercation with Hevener at the store, which was consistent with evidence at the crime scene, Commonwealth Attorney Raymond Robertson said. Bruises on Hevener's body were inconsistent with injuries that would have resulted from a fall after being shot, he told reporters.  \"She expressed shame in herself. I never saw any tears. She expressed her concern for the family members [of the victims], as to bringing closure to this case,\" police investigator Mike King said.  Smith told police she acted alone, authorities said. But Staunton Police Chief Jim Williams said questions about the case remain.  \"There will likely be questions surrounding this case we will never be able to answer,\" he said.  One of those questions was the whereabouts of the murder weapon, but a late development Friday may have solved that mystery.  In the November interview, Smith told police she gave the weapon to a detective on the police force in 1967, David Bocock, and that he buried it.  \"He just said that it was sort of dangerous to have a gun, you could hurt somebody,\" Smith said, according to the transcript. \"He said, 'I'll fix it for you if you want.' I figured it was the best thing to do.\"  It was unclear whether Bocock, who died in 2006, knew of Smith's involvement in the murders. The two knew each other, as Bocock taught Smith to shoot, but authorities said they were still investigating the relationship and whether Bocock was trying to cover for Smith.  Later Friday, the Staunton News-Leader newspaper reported its circulation manager had turned over to police a .25-caliber automatic handgun.  Kathy Myers told the newspaper that Bocock gave the gun to her now-deceased husband, a former Staunton police officer, in 1981, telling him, \"Don't let anybody know I gave this to you.\"  Myers said she forgot she had the gun until she saw the police news conference Friday, and turned it over to authorities.  Myers told the News-Leader that King said the gun matches the description Smith gave police."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/320bf9812f71cc4b832f6fb53e0cbdf2fcf758e0.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does the process allow?", "id": "107957", "answers": [{"text": "encourage folks to directly confront that past and how to get behind it,\"", "answer_start": 2178}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- As Iraqi officials speak loftily of ethnic and political reconciliation, Abu Wissam seethes.    In April 2006, two Iraqis mourn a relative slain in sectarian violence in the city of Falluja.    He wants cold, hard justice for the killers of his son, Raed, a 25-year-old business school graduate, \"cut to pieces\" by Mehdi Army militia members in their Baghdad neighborhood.    The Wissams are among the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis caught in the maelstrom of the militia violence that rippled across Iraq after the 2006 bombing in Samarra of the Askariya Mosque, a Shiite shrine.    The kind of trauma and pain endured by the Wissam family is kindling an interest in a social healing process adopted by countries around the world -- truth commissions. They are bodies across the globe that have provided a forum for victims and perpetrators to give cathartic public testimony on human rights abuses and come up with policy recommendations to correct the root cause of the abuses.    \"Iraq, like many Arab cultures, is an intensely rich narrative culture,\" said Miranda Sissons, Iraq director of the International Center for Transitional Justice, which helps countries pursuing accountability for past mass atrocities and human rights abuses. \"The idea of standing up and witnessing is tremendously appealing, the kind of act and mechanism they can understand.\"  Watch how the \"business of death\" continues to thrive \u00bb    The U.S. Institute of Peace -- one of the independent agencies behind the all-important Iraq Study Group report in 2006 -- is backing an initiative in Iraq to generate understanding and \"spark public dialogue on the usefulness of the truth commission process.\"    The institute is teaming up with Iraq's Ministry of Human Rights to screen a USIP film across Iraq about the work of four different commissions.    Called \"Confronting The Truth: Truth Commissions and Societies in Transition,\" the film -- produced by York Zimmerman and Peter Ackerman -- explores the workings of such commissions in South Africa, Peru, Morocco and East Timor. The film is getting some good reviews among Iraqis.    \"The truth commission process is one in which you encourage folks to directly confront that past and how to get behind it,\" said Sermid Al-Sarraf, the executive director of the International Institute for the Rule of Law, a group that manages USIP's rule of law programs in Iraq.    Truth commissions and other conflict-resolution strategies have been on Iraq's radar for years.    Oral history projects have emerged, one being the Iraq History Project -- which \"gathers and analyzes personal narratives from victims, their families, witnesses, perpetrators and others\" about the \"torture, massacres, assassinations, rape, chemical weapons attacks, disappearances, and other acts of systematic repression\" during the Saddam Hussein regime. That project is managed by the International Human Rights Law Institute of DePaul University College of Law in Chicago and is run by an all-Iraqi in-country staff.    Last year, Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari's Crisis Management Initiative and a conflict-resolution initiative at the University of Massachusetts Boston were behind an effort to forge the so-called Helsinki agreement -- a statement of reconciliation principles among a wide range of Iraqi politicians. That process was notable because former antagonists in Northern Ireland and South Africa worked with the Iraqis.    Padraig O'Malley, a UMass conflict-resolution professor involved in the Helsinki process, is planning a three-day forum in April for \"divided cities,\" where officials from ethnically tense Kirkuk in Iraq will discuss common problems with officials from Derry/Londonderry and Belfast in Northern Ireland, Nicosia in Cyprus, and Mitrovica in Kosovo.    The International Center for Transitional Justice says Coalition Provisional Authority officials initially proposed a \"truth-seeking commission\" for Iraq in 2003 but eventually decided to \"delay the process\" in order for Iraqis to rigorously study other truth-telling efforts, as advocated by the center. In 2005, the center also discussed the establishment of a center for the missing and disappeared.    As for truth commissions today, some observers say there hasn't been the political will on the part of the national government to pursue one. So says Joost Hilterman, International Crisis Group deputy program director for the Middle East and North Africa. He has argued in the past for the establishment of a truth commission process and believes such a process, for example, would have been the proper way to deal with the challenge of de-Baathification.    \"I'm not against floating the idea,\" Hilterman said, but there's \"no chance in hell\" it would happen anytime soon.    Eduardo Gonzalez, the Americas deputy director of the transitional justice center, had been a staffer on the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where he was responsible for public hearings and victims and witnesses protection. He was interviewed in the USIP video, which featured touching testimony from victims of the warfare between government troops and Shining Path guerrillas between 1980 and 2000.    Gonzalez stressed the need to produce an accurate account of abuses, provide explanations for what happened, provide the proper opportunity for victims to be recognized, and help the society steer a new course for the future. Truth commissions don't function as courts, and there are only rare occasions, such as in East Timor, where punishment would be meted out.    \"Truth commissions, done right, could created a public dialogue,\" he said.    He thinks a national Iraqi truth commission would probably be a few years down the road. But he thinks it's more likely that a particular city, province or region could pursue them.    One particular truth commission, in Morocco, has been cited as one that Iraq could study. That's because it was the first one in the Arab world and it detailed human rights abuses from 1956 to 1999 under King Hassan II.    Gonzalez said Iraq can benefit from studying all models, but he notes they share one thing -- a commitment to objectivity.    The ICTJ's Sissons notes that the British explored the idea of a truth commission as well, but experts told them Iraqis and not outsiders are the ones who need to pursue such an idea. She also said \"the scale of violence\" in Iraq and the \"nature and complexity\" of it \"is so vast\" that the German war crimes tribunals after World War II and the reparations to Holocaust victims come to mind.    But if a truth initiative is to be effective, it would have to be rigorously designed and properly framed, with a \"distinct focus\" and an \"achievable mandate,\" she said. There must be commitment, goals, dedication and governmental support in areas such as subpoenaing records.    \"You don't just tell the truth, hold hands and sing 'Kumbaya,' \" she said.    But they can be very useful in Iraq, an \"evidence-rich environment.\" She said truth-telling commissions there could lead to many improvements in society, such as better detention registration policies, higher forensic standards, a freedom of information law, and a far-reaching reparations strategy.    As for the man on the street, people who gather at Abu Wissam's house to talk about the violence they've endured don't talk of forgiveness. They want the killers of their kin to be put to death.    Al-Sarraf and others all agree justice must be served in cases of heinous crime. But he seized on the concept of forgiveness. It's an Islamic virtue, and it could play a powerful role in a truth-telling initiative.    \"Even though there is the principle of 'eye for an eye,' there is also the higher ideal of mercy,\" he said.

Smith was brought to a local hospital in serious condition, officials said    At 7 p.m. Wednesday Smith died at Parkland Hospital, the medical examiner's office said. An autopsy is slated for Thursday.    Two people were killed in the shootings along a three-mile stretch on and near the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas.    Police used ballistic tests to link Smith, a 12-year veteran of the Utah state police, to three of the four shootings, Dallas Police Lt. Craig Miller said Tuesday.    Miller said Smith was a suspect in both nonfatal shootings and one of the fatal shootings. He said it was unclear if Smith was a suspect in the fatal shooting that occurred first.    The first attack occurred in the city of Garland at about 5:41 p.m. Victim Jorge Lopez, 20, was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light in Garland when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car, killing him, Officer Joe Harn of the Garland police said.    A few minutes later and two miles away on the LBJ Freeway, a gunman fired at two tractor-trailers.    While one driver escaped injuries, William Scott Miller, 42, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck, police said.    \"He was going to be traveling home,\" Lt. Miller said. \"He was about to park his rig. He was going to get on a plane to fly to be with his wife and children for the Christmas season and then come back to this location.\"    Miller called the truck driver a hero because he was able to control his rig before he died -- preventing other motorists from being hurt.    The fourth attack came a mile west on LBJ Freeway, where gunfire shattered the windshield of another tractor-trailer. The bullets missed the driver, but flying glass caused minor cuts, police said.    Smith, 37, left his trooper job in Utah after he was caught abusing alcohol and drugs, CNN affiliate WFAA reported, citing an official report. The sergeant began using drugs and alcohol after his patrol car was rear-ended while he was writing a ticket, according to the report by Utah Peace Officers Standards and Training.    He moved to Texas shortly afterward, the station said.    Harn told WFAA that Smith's wife had phoned police Monday to say her husband was suicidal and driving around with a gun. Police were able to locate him using cell phone transmission towers. A three-hour stand-off followed, ending when Smith shot himself in the head, Harn said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/be448f005a1557118b0368a05c93c58ed65e5126.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is excavating landfill?", "id": "107960", "answers": [{"text": "Investigators", "answer_start": 9}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Investigators searching for a missing 8-month-old boy began an intensive excavation and search effort Tuesday at a Texas landfill.    \"Let me say this, that we do remain hopeful that baby Gabriel is alive,\" William McManus, chief of the San Antonio Police Department, said at a news conference at the landfill.    \"We are, however, conducting both a missing persons investigation as well as a homicide investigation,\" he said, adding that aspects surrounding Gabriel Johnson's disappearance involve elements of a possible homicide.    Gabriel has been missing since December 26 and was last seen in San Antonio, with his 23-year-old mother, Elizabeth Johnson, who has refused to disclose information on his whereabouts.    She told Gabriel's father she killed the boy and has also said she gave him away to a couple in San Antonio, police say. Johnson drove Gabriel to San Antonio from Tempe, Arizona, and she went to Florida a week later, according to investigators.    Johnson was arrested in Florida and extradited to Maricopa County, Arizona, where she remains behind bars, charged with kidnapping, custodial interference and child abuse.    A lead prompted investigators to focus on the landfill, which is owned by Republic Services, a waste and environmental services company based in Phoenix, Arizona. The part of the landfill that will be searched has been pinpointed, according to McManus.    First, it will take at least six days to remove 45 feet of garbage that has piled up since the time investigators believe evidence may have been dumped in the area.    \"Once we have removed the debris and have searched our target area, we will begin the arduous task of sifting through layers in the search for possible evidence,\" McManus said.    \"This phase will be a long and repetitive cycle. Search teams will be looking for anything of evidentiary value.\"    Cadaver dogs will assist the search teams in the effort, which will be conducted weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., McManus said. He estimated more than 20 people will be involved.    Rain would not compromise any evidence but could cause dangerous toxic runoff, which Fire Department and hazardous materials experts would work to contain.    San Antonio police have been working with the FBI and Tempe police.

Five people, including three young children, were found dead in this house in Middletown, Maryland.    Christopher Wood, 34, may have slashed at least some of his family members in the killings and used a small-caliber handgun on others, Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said.    He was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted shotgun wound at the foot of the bed where the bodies of his wife and 2-year-old daughter lay, the sheriff said.

Her family had not seen the Woods for about a day and her father forced his way into the locked home, finding the bodies, according to Jenkins.    Authorities said a shotgun was found next to Christopher Wood's body and a .25-caliber handgun was found in a \"container\" in the kitchen. The sheriff said other weapons that could have been used to stab and cut the victims were found, but he did not say what those weapons were.  Watch sheriff's department's statement \u00bb    Francie Wood's family were longtime residents of the Middletown area. Her brother had recently retired from a career as a sheriff's deputy, Jenkins said.    The family had moved to town from Florida about four months ago.    \"We're all in shock,\" said the Rev. Kevin Farmer, the family's minister at Holy Family Catholic Church. \"This was a family, though they hadn't been with us very long, they are an integral part of our community.\" Watch views from the crime scene \u00bb    He said the road the Woods lived on is a shortcut to the church and he would often see the children while riding a scooter he uses when the weather is good.    \"They would always stop and wave and get big eyes as the scooter came by,\" he said. \"They were very happy kids.\"    Jenkins said autopsies will be performed on the bodies over the next few days and that it could be weeks before the results are ready to be released.    Jenkins told CNN that at least five notes apparently handwritten by Wood were found inside the home. While the notes didn't immediately tell investigators what prompted the killings, they did provide some insight into possible problems, the sheriff said.    \"There is some indication in at least one of the notes that there might have been some psychological issues with Mr. Wood,\" Jenkins said.    Cpl. Jennifer Bailey said deputies went to the home shortly after 9 a.m. after Mrs. Wood's father called. The family had not been seen for several days, Bailey said.    Authorities said several weapons, including a shotgun, were found inside the home.    Christopher Wood had been an employee of CSX Railroad, Jenkins said. He said the sheriff's office had no record of domestic violence or other family disputes at the Woods' home.    \"In my entire career, just about 20 years, this is probably the worst tragedy I've ever been a part of or ever seen in Frederick County,\" Jenkins said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/81cd433ee694c711344d5296ef22609d71f86601.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many people were on the plane?", "id": "107964", "answers": [{"text": "About 87 passengers and 10 crew", "answer_start": 361}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- A Sudanese plane that was hijacked shortly after taking off from Nyala in the country's Darfur region, presumably by rebels, has landed in Kufra, Libya, said Sudan's ambassador to the United States.    \"I believe since it started in the sovereign state of Darfur. ... It is more likely something to do with the rebels in that area,\" John Ukec said.    About 87 passengers and 10 crew members are thought to be on board, Ukec said. It was unclear how many hijackers were on board.    The hijacker or hijackers wanted to land the plane in Egypt, but the Egyptian government refused them permission, Ukec said.    However, an Egyptian civil aviation official disputed that.    \"The hijacked plane never entered Egyptian airspace,\" said Capt. Shirbeeni, the head of Egypt's civil aviation control. \"It never requested to land on Egyptian soil. ... We understand that it had a tank that would allow it to fly for four hours. It flew directly toward Kufra.\"    A reporter from Al-Shuruq, a Dubai-based Sudanese network funded by Sudan's government, said passengers on the plane include some officials from the interim government of Darfur, Sudan's war-torn region.    Libya's state-run Jamahirya television, citing civil aviation sources, reported that the hijacked plane landed in Kufra, in eastern Libya.    \"We are in contact with Libyan officials because of this dangerous event,\" Murtada Hassam Jumaa, an official with Sun Air airlines, told Al-Shuruq. \"We want to resolve this situation as soon as we can in a way where we can guarantee the safety of all our passengers.\"    Asked whether the airline received any threat before the flight took off, he said, \"There were no signs of any terrorist or criminal activity on the plane. We checked the plane like we do with all other planes. We followed the regular security checkup. We still don't have any information on what type of weapons were used.\"    Jumaa also said 87 passengers were on board the plane.    The hijacking follows a Monday attack involving Sudanese government troops at the Kalma refugee camp, 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from Nyala. It was unclear whether the incidents are related.    The United Nations African Mission in Darfur said the government of Sudan reported that its military and police forces were granted a search warrant for drugs and weapons and raided the camp in executing the warrants. UNAMID said 60 government vehicles surrounded the camp.    The refugees resisted the government's attempts to enter the camp, however, and \"the situation escalated into confrontation and exchange of gunfire, with no indication as to who started it.\" The gunfire lasted about two hours, UNAMID said.    \"On the basis of information provided to the UNAMID team while on site, the casualty toll amounted to 64 killed and 117 wounded, of which 49 were evacuated by UNAMID to the Nyala hospital,\" the organization said in a written statement.    Sudanese military and police were heavily armed, the organization said, but the refugees had only sticks, knives and spears.    Sudanese security forces reported that they were met by a human shield of women and children, with gunfire coming from behind them, prompting them to return fire.    \"UNAMID strongly condemns the excessive, disproportionate use of lethal force by the [government] security forces against civilians, which violated their human rights and resulted in unacceptable casualties,\" the UNAMID statement said.

Making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back.  Mildred and Eduardo Gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported.  His wife faces deportation to Guatemala -- her home country that she hasn't seen since 1989. He also doesn't know what would happen to his young son, Eduardo Jr., if that happens.  \"I like being in uniform and serving my country, but if she goes back I'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job,\" he said.  \"Defending the country that's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind.\"  Gonzalez, who works on helicopters that bring cargo, supplies and military personnel in and out of Iraq, testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel last month, detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his, where military members' families could be deported while they're defending their country overseas.  Watch \"they're tearing families apart\" \u00bb  \"I want to serve my country 100 percent. But with this issue in the back of my mind, I feel I can't do that,\" he testified on September 6.  The U.S. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases. Each is handled case-by-case, not by the military, but by immigration authorities. The government doesn't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar  to Gonzalez's.  Immigration officials also said marrying a U.S. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status.  Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves who teaches immigration law at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members.  \"You got to understand. When you're in a combat zone, you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy. You can't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you're never going to see them again,\" she said.  Stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases. On the one hand, the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance, housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas. On the other hand, the same government is trying to deport the very same people.  \"What's happening right now is, because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws, we've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home,\" she said.  In Gonzalez's case, his wife, Mildred, came to the United States with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old. They were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Guatemala.  In September 2000, Mildred's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application. Her mother was granted legal status in July 2004, according to Gonzalez.  However, six weeks earlier, Gonzalez and Mildred got married, canceling Mildred's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21. As a result, her legal status still remains in jeopardy.  A judge in June granted her a one-year extension to remain in the United States. If her legal status does not change by June 8, 2008, she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation.  That's just fine, according to Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration.  \"What you're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces, and that's just outrageous,\" he said. \"What we're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military. ... There's no justification for that kind of policy.\"  Gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified. \"I'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too.\"  Gonzalez himself entered the country legally, crossing the Mexican border with his family when he was about 10. He joined the Navy as a so-called \"green-card sailor\" and became a U.S. citizen in July 2005. The military does accept some immigrants who aren't U.S. citizens.  \"I understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained, but on the other token, there are times when the situation is just out of their reach,\" Gonzalez said.  His wife, Mildred, added, \"We didn't come here to break the law. We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else.\"  U.S. Army Sgt. Emmanuel Woko, a member of the Army's 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division who faces his third tour in Iraq, understands just how Gonzalez and his family feel. His wife and children could be sent back to Nigeria.  \"My heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to Nigeria while I am deployed in Iraq,\" he said. \"I am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought.\"  That's a sentiment echoed by Gonzalez: \"We are not asking for anything. We are just asking for our families to stay with us.\" E-mail to a friend  CNN's Gregg Canes contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4416697581fcfb00260d8fb161822306f4e12f76.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What began after heavy rains caused waters to smash through a dam?", "id": "107972", "answers": [{"text": "The flood", "answer_start": 557}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- The death toll from a flash flood in Indonesia's capital grew to 98 people on Sunday as rescuers widened their search for more than 130 other people in the aftermath.      Members of a search and rescue team look for bodies near  Jakarta.      The nation's health ministry said 62 women, 31 men and three students had been killed.      Of those, 12 bodies remained unidentified, ministry spokesman Rustam Pakaya said.      Another 13 people were missing. The search for the missing will be called off Sunday night, he said.      The flood started Friday morning after heavy rains caused waters to smash through a dam and rush into Jakarta.   The breach unleashed a torrent of water that plowed into hundreds of homes in what some survivors described as a suburban \"tsunami.\"      About 1,500 volunteers -- mostly students from two flooded universities in Jakarta -- are assisting in the search and rescue effort, said Mardjito, a social affairs ministry official who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name.      He said rescuers started using heavy machinery to lift debris. Still, the death toll is expected to rise.      At least 50 people were injured and nearly 1,500 have been displaced. Mardjito said a camp for survivors so far has adequate supplies as members of political parties continue to send food, blankets, flashlights and other items amid a major election year.      Sleeping residents were taken by surprise by the powerful flash flood as it crashed through the crowded Cirendeu district near Jakarta early Friday.  Watch scenes of the flood devastation \u00bb      Drenched and shivering survivors were taking refuge on the rooftops of their homes as rescuers in rubber boats were struggling to reach them, said social affairs ministry official Mardjito.      Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, currently on the campaign trail ahead of the elections later this year, has said he had ordered senior ministers to visit the scene of the disaster.      \"On behalf of the government, I express my condolences to the families of the dead victims and may their souls be accepted by God almighty,\" he said, according to the official Antara news agency.      The rain obliterated a 255-meter-long section of the dam, releasing a wall of water from a 20-hectare lake that some survivors said reminded them of the tsunami that hit Indonesia in 2004.      \"They said they had heard loud rumbling sounds like during a powerful earthquake. They later found out that the sounds came from the water rushing out from the dam's lake,\" according to Antara.      Floods from heavy rains are an annual occurrence in and around Jakarta, a low-lying city on the northern coast of Java island, where poor infrastructure often results in polluted canals and rivers overflowing their banks and spilling into thousands of homes.      In 2007, 38 people were killed and 430,000 forced from their homes when storm water 3 meters deep in some places swamped 75 percent of the capital, which is home to about 9 million people.      With poor sanitation and a hot and humid climate, the risk of water-borne diseases is usually a major concern following floods in the city, where mosquito-transmitted malaria is also a threat.

Investigating the attacks will be difficult because they happened in remote areas, Royal Dutch Shell says.    The attacks were against pipelines in the eastern part of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, said the spokesman, Rainer Winzenried.    \"Shell is investigating the impact on facilities, the environment and the production capabilities,\" he said.    The attacks happened in remote areas, making investigations difficult, he said, adding that the company would not send in investigators until it was certain the area was secure. It was not known whether there were any casualties, he said.    The pipelines are part of a Shell joint venture that provides oil to several companies, Winzenried said. Shell runs the venture, and Nigeria is the operator.    Winzenried refused to speculate on who was behind the attacks, but Nigeria's main militant group -- the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND -- said it had attacked an offshore facility earlier Sunday and that \"the structure is ... engulfed in fire.\"    Winzenried had no information about that claim.    MEND, which demands a fairer distribution of Nigeria's oil wealth, claimed Friday that it destroyed a pipeline owned and operated by the Italian gas company Agip, but Agip has not confirmed that report.    Earlier in the week, MEND claimed to have destroyed Royal Dutch Shell's main trunk line in Bayelsa state and a Chevron oil station in the delta region. Shell confirmed an attack on that pipeline and said it had shut it down to avoid an environmental impact. Chevron, which halted its onshore operations in the region last month, said it was investigating.    Last month, the militant group declared an \"all-out war\" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians.    It is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be invested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians.    The militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/6229e71abd22f39aa95a06a17eda00da4a420edd.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "iReporters share their experience of what?", "id": "107979", "answers": [{"text": "Living in tight quarters", "answer_start": 1015}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Kate Meinhardt felt like a clown jammed into a Volkswagen bug when she lived in a 21-square-foot room aboard a circus train.  Kate Meinhardt crammed her life into a 21-square-foot room while she lived aboard a circus train.  Bungee cords crisscrossed her walls once a week to prevent an avalanche of items from raining down. A microwave, mini refrigerator, her laptop and baskets of personal items lined the dorm-like room.  Showering, going to the bathroom and even doing laundry became racing contests on the train, Meinhardt said. The 13 people on board shared one shower, two toilets and one washer and dryer.  \"It's a pretty tough life living in such a small space,\" she said. The 23-year-old spent almost a year as an animal handler for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.  While most iReporters haven't run off to join the circus, some have traded in their homes for smaller digs. One iReporter even opted for a floating lifestyle, where he could sail away at a moment's notice. iReport.com: Living in tight quarters  Living on a 25-foot boat was only supposed to be temporary, but Jim Smith loved it so much he stayed there for a year.  \"I have lived in a 25-foot sailboat, a 28-foot motor home, a 32-foot sailboat and now an 800 square-foot apartment,\" Smith said in his iReport. \"I was happiest with the 25-foot sailboat.\"  While docked in Panama City, Florida, Smith kept his expenses to a minimum. The marina slip rent was only $200 and electricity was included in the rent, he said.  The boat did not have refrigeration so Smith kept his food inside an insulated ice box. For 79 cents at the discount grocery store, he could buy a 10-pound bag of ice that would last him several days, even during the summer.  Air conditioning wasn't a luxury Smith had either, but fans and sea breezes kept him cool.  \"Sometimes the less you have, the more you like it,\" he said.  The portable lifestyle also charmed a father-son duo who set out on a yearlong European vacation. A camper van took them wherever they wanted, whenever they wanted.  Spencer Pearson and his 15-year-old son, Bryce, bought a 150-square-foot van in Germany for their European excursion. Living out of the van meant \"no reservations, no packing and unpacking of suitcases, no strange beds,\" Pearson said.  Modern amenities weren't amiss on the van, which included everything from the Internet and entertainment to a complete bath and kitchen, and there were occasional hotel stays and meals out that made the trip more pleasant.  The simple life also enticed Deborah Greant and her husband to trade in their Calgary, Canada, home for an RV.  Both she and her husband have neuromuscular problems and needed extra help taking care of their large home. Since moving into a 240-square-foot RV, they can manage the house themselves.  \"We didn't want to be owned by our things,\" Greant said. \"We jettisoned pretty much everything except things from former generations.\"  While two people living in an RV can be tight, imagine a family of six trying to do the same.  Mounting living expenses and a job relocation prompted the Chervenkas to sell their home and move into a 32-foot RV. Two pets came along, too.  The Chervenkas weren't forced to do this. Their goal was to become debt-free and save money for their children's college educations.  When pilot Tim Chervenka got transferred to Charlotte, North Carolina, the family set up camp in a 32-foot RV. The temporary situation turned into a permanent one.  The family said goodbye to paying a first and second mortgage and pricey utilities. They now pay only $500 a month, utilities included.  \"It's made such an adjustment in our personal life without the juggling,\" Cindy Chervenka said. \"We have so much more family time. It's a good feeling.\"  Cindy Chervenka has some advice for others thinking of a drastic downsizing: \"Step out of your comfort zone and try it. We didn't plan on doing this full-time, but once we discovered it, we thought, 'hey we can do this forever!' Until you step out and try it, you'll think it's not doable.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/002c962834b7886c600a31a35053543e324883bd.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who do they want transitioned?", "id": "107984", "answers": [{"text": "John Hinckley Jr.,", "answer_start": 76}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- A hearing continues Thursday to determine the future of John Hinckley Jr., who shot President Ronald Reagan and three others in March 1981.      After an expected week and half of testimony, a federal judge will consider whether Hinckley should eventually be released from a mental hospital, where he has been a patient since his 1982 trial. The trial ended in a jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.      On Wednesday, Hinckley's lawyers said he is not dangerous and should eventually be released. But prosecutors are fighting that, saying Hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia.      In opening statements, prosecutor Sarah Chasson said Secret Service agents will testify they performed surveillance on Hinckley without his knowledge earlier this year when he was allowed what he was told was unsupervised free time in Williamsburg.      On several occasions in July and September, Hinckley was supposed to go to the movies or shopping but instead went to bookstores where he looked at books about Ronald Reagan and presidential assassins, Chasson said. A requirement of Hinckley's current visitation program is that plans be laid out detailing what he will do when on his own and that medical staff and the Secret Service are informed.      According to Chasson, in the first instance in July, Hinckley was supposed to go to the movie \"Captain America.\" Later when he saw his \"treatment team,\" Hinckley not only maintained he had gone to the movie, but he enthusiastically recommended it.      Chasson also quoted from a 1987 diary entry by Hinckley in which he said \"psychiatry is a guessing game\" and doctors \"will never know the true John Hinckley.\"      \"The hospital doesn't know what Mr. Hinckley is thinking, and he wants it that way,\" the prosecutor said.      Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said the issue is not whether Hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous.      \"This man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous,\" Levine said. He added that Hinckley is \"flawed\" but is \"fundamentally decent.\"      Levine said that in the two and a half decades that Hinckley has been at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility, there has \"not been a single act of violence.\"      Since 1999, Levine said, Hinckley has been taking a drug called Risperdal. Medical websites describe Risperdal as an antipsychotic medication often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.      Dr. Tyler Jones, director of psychiatry at St. Elizabeths, testified Hinckley also started taking Zoloft in 2005 after complaining about anxiety.      Jones said Hinckley had been diagnosed years ago as suffering from depression and from an unspecified psychotic disorder. But Jones said he's been in remission for both of those disorders for many years. He said Hinckley also suffers from narcissism, which has improved but is still present. Jones said he has interviewed Hinckley but has not treated him.      According to Jones, Hinckley's treatment team was informed by the Secret Service that Hinckley had not told the truth about his activities during several visits. Jones said the medical staff discussed this issue with Hinckley, who initially did not appear to view the issue as a big deal, but later understood it was a serious issue.      Although concerned Hinckley was not truthful about his activities, Jones said, \"We didn't feel this constituted an increased risk.\" The staff decided to reduce Hinckley's Christmas visit to his mother from 10 days to five days, and he will not be allowed to have any unaccompanied activities during that December stay. Jones said the staff had considered stronger action including the possibility of revoking Hinckley's privileges altogether.      A September filing by prosecutors said Hinckley \"continues to be deceptive regarding his relationships with and interest in women.\" According to the document, in June of 2009 he went on the Internet to find photos of his female dentist. \"When he was caught, Hinckley claimed, falsely, that the dentist had invited him to view her personal photographs.\"      Asked about the photographs of the dentist, Jones said the photographs were of the woman graduating from dental school and were \"not salacious.\"      He said the hospital considers Hinckley \"a low risk of violence to himself and others.\"      Currently, Hinckley is allowed to visit his mother 10 days a month. On July 29, St. Elizabeths Hospital filed a proposal to increase that. The first step would allow Hinckley to have two visits of 17 days. That would be followed by six visits of 24 days.      According to the September government filing opposing the plan, the hospital would then \"be given the sole discretion to place Hinckley on convalescent leave in his mother's hometown.\"      After the judge and all the lawyers were in place, Hinckley, now 56, entered the court wearing a brown sports jacket, dark pants and a striped tie. He shook hands with all his lawyers and sat down. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman greeted Hinckley and he replied, saying, \"Good morning.\"      Hinckley's defense team has listed him as a possible witness at the proceedings but has not revealed if he will definitely testify. Prosecutors want to cross-examine Hinckley and his defense lawyers oppose that.      Mental health experts and Secret Service agents will testify, along with Hinckley's brother and sister. Hinckley's mother is now 85 years old and is not a scheduled witness.      It's not clear how quickly the judge might issue a ruling on the hospital's plan to gradually allow Hinckley greater freedom.      On March 30, 1981, Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington Hotel after a speech. He opened fire and hit Reagan, his press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police officer Thomas Delahanty. All survived, but Brady suffered a serious head wound that permanently affected his mobility and his speech.      Hinckley, who was 25 at the time of the shooting, was enamored of actress Jodie Foster. He left a letter addressed to her in his Washington hotel room saying, \"Dear Jodie. There is a definite possibility I will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/e7dff142f274e6ad68ecfa89675cbdc2501922ff.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What show were his songs on?", "id": "107985", "answers": [{"text": "\"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"American Idol\"", "answer_start": 1146}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- He performed at Ellen DeGeneres' wedding this past summer, and he's as quick-witted as Adam Sandler.

Since actor Zach Braff -- a buddy from Northwestern University -- promoted the Cleveland, Ohio-born musician's tunes on the TV sitcom \"Scrubs,\" Radin's vulnerable lyrics and whispery delivery have caught on. Primetime programs like \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"American Idol\" also used his music, and before long Radin had a debut album -- 2006's critically acclaimed \"We Were Here\" -- and a reason to hit the road.      Radin (who has a loud, hearty laugh for a guy whose songs are pretty melancholy) dropped by CNN's New York offices to talk about how he landed that wedding gig, and some of the unusual surfaces he uses to jot down lyrics. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch Radin cause hearts to melt \u00bb      CNN: A lot of your songs are about heartache and heartbreak. Are you sad all the time?      Joshua Radin: No, not at all. Just tired.      CNN: Why so tired?      Radin: Because I play a lot of shows all the time. When you're trying to get your music out to as many people as humanly possible, you gotta go places ... all the time, and talk about it and play songs and you get a little less sleep than you might like. It's cool. But in terms of the heartache I guess I get my sad out by writing songs.      CNN: How do you get your happy out?      Radin: Hanging out with people I like.      CNN: Speaking of people you like, Zach Braff [is] a big buddy of yours ...      Radin: Never met him.      CNN: Liar!      Radin: He's a very close friend and he's been very supportive.      CNN: Some might say that without Zach Braff's support you might not have come to the fore as you have ...      Radin: I wouldn't even be born.      CNN: Do you sort of feel like you are going to be indebted to him for the rest of your life?      Radin: No, he's pretty much indebted to me. I mean he got to launch my career (laughs). I'm just kidding.      CNN: You sang at Ellen DeGeneres' wedding. How did that come about?      Radin: I played her show in January and she came up to me after we soundchecked the song [\"Today\"] and said, \"That's the song I want to walk down the aisle to.\" And I thought she was just being nice, really.      And then about two days before the wedding -- I was on tour -- I got a call saying she wanted me to come in and she was going to have her wedding for a very intimate gathering at her house. And she wanted me to play about five or six of my songs ...      CNN: The happy ones, I hope.      Radin: Yeah, I only have about five or six songs about falling in love. The rest are about falling out of love or about politics or something ... things that maybe wouldn't be great for a wedding.      And I'd never played a wedding. [I] had never really gone to any weddings ... but I sang six of my own songs and it was really cool. [There were] about 20 people sitting around a couch in her living room, and Portia [de Rossi] and Ellen were sitting in two chairs right in front of me and I got walked in. I was Ellen's surprise for Portia.      CNN: Tell me about the single.      Radin: It's called \"I'd Rather Be With You.\" It's a little love song. I wrote it about my ex-girlfriend right after we broke up and I was missing her. But the song doesn't sound sad. It's sort of about someone who waits on you a long time to make a decision and then after it's over, how we all want something more ... after it's gone. The video is just me and Katrina Bowden, the actress from \"30 Rock,\" and we shot it on Super 8 so it's real grainy and looks like an old home movie. It was Zach's concept.      CNN: You started out as a screenwriter ...      Radin: Sort of. I started out as a painter and an art teacher for kids. That's what I studied in school and I taught fifth through seventh grade in Chicago. And then I lived in New York for about six years writing screenplays. And then about four years ago I wrote my first song.      CNN: So in terms of expressing yourself artistically, songs are where you feel at home?      Radin: At the moment. I like to express myself creatively and it doesn't matter the medium. Whatever medium I choose at that moment, whatever works the best. It's like choosing production on a song; whether [you use] drums or piano or guitar ... you service the song. So in terms of the medium I guess I service the sentiment. If there's something that I really need to say that I can't say by speaking to someone, I usually write it in a song or a letter to someone. I usually can be more honest writing songs than actually talking to people.      CNN: What would you say is the best setting to listen to your music?      Radin: Driving in the car on a road trip. Riding the subway. Traveling. It's traveling music.      CNN: Because you're a traveler? You're a bit of a nomad?      Radin: I am and I write my songs usually while I'm walking around. Or in a car. Or in a bus, a plane, something like that. I jot down lyrics wherever I am. Usually it's on a vomit bag on an airplane or something. [I] just look for a pen (laughs)."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/1d66cf286afeeb2bb177453bb1de75d06ba80bb1.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What has Tim Howard done?", "id": "107990", "answers": [{"text": "won 29 caps for USA.", "answer_start": 860}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- CNN gave you the chance to pitch your questions to Team USA's goalkeeper Tim Howard recently and now he has answered.

Members of the delegation will include Rep. Donald M. Payne, D-New Jersey and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights; former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell; Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of African Affairs Johnnie Carson; U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan Princeton N. Lyman; Deputy National Security Adviser Brooke Anderson; Donald K. Steinberg, deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development; Gen. Carter F. Ham, commander of United States Africa Command; R. Barrie Walkley, U.S. consul general in Juba; and Ken Hackett, president of Catholic Relief Services.      Two senior administration officials said they expected the Obama administration to announce its intention to name an ambassador to the new nation.      Lyman has already traveled to the region to foster a smooth transition between the two countries. He is visiting Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and is expected to join former South African President Thabo Mbeki in support of ongoing talks between officials in Khartoum, Sudan, and Juba -- a fast-growing city soon to become South Sudan's new capital.      The two men are expected to lend support to a peace agreement that ended Sudan's second civil war, and help moderate potential conflicts over resource sharing, disputed border areas and citizenship matters, the State Department said.      Lyman is expected to travel to Khartoum for meetings with senior Sudanese officials, the statement said, and then to Juba to attend South Sudan's independence ceremony.      The flurry of U.S. diplomatic activity comes as satellite images released Wednesday reveal a heavy north Sudanese military presence in an oil-rich border region.      Images from the U.S.-based Satellite Sentinel Project showed an apparent Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) convoy of \"significant size\" traveling through the town of Kadugli.      The monitoring group, started by actor George Clooney, said the convoy was 2 kilometers in length and included about 1,000 troops and heavy trucks carrying artillery.      \"Less than a week after signing yet another agreement, the Sudanese regime appears to be ignoring its commitment, holding to form, and positioning military assets for intensified offensive operations,\" said John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project, which aims to end genocide and war crimes.      \"This cycle will continue to be played out with increasingly destructive results for Sudanese civilians until the international community stiffens its spine and imposes swift and severe repercussions for the endless cycle of violence the Khartoum regime continues to fuel.\"      The Satellite Sentinel Project combines satellite imagery analysis and field reports with mapping technology in hopes of deterring the resumption of the bloody and bitter civil war north and south fought for decades.      The monitoring group said fighting between the Sudanese forces and the south's Sudan People's Liberation Army has been reported in the city of Kadugli in the past week.      Southerners voted for independence in a January referendum, and with the scheduled July 9 date of separation looming, many fear an escalation of bloodshed could bring both sides back to the brink of full-scale war.      Violence erupted two months ago along the contested border area of Abyei and subsequently in South Kordofan, a state that lies north of the border but where many people, especially in the Nuba Mountains, are allied with the south.      Thousands of people were displaced from their homes, and many fear that, after strict borders go into place with independence, they will not be able to return home.      \"South Sudan will be born into crisis,\" predicted Susan Purdin, who oversees International Rescue Committee aid programs in South Sudan.      \"Widening violence is triggering more displacement, threatening the lives of vulnerable civilians and hampering access to communities in need while an existing humanitarian emergency grows worse,\" she said.      Critical issues -- including oil and the final status of Abyei -- remain unresolved.      State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States applauded talks between north and south but remained concerned about the unresolved matters.      \"The United States also calls on the parties to end the fighting in Southern Kordofan, and to facilitate unfettered access for aid workers to deliver humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians affected by the conflict,\" Nuland said.      Discussions are under way on how to shape the post-independence U.N. mission in South Sudan, created in 2005 with a peacekeeping mandate. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has intervened in pushing the parties to accept U.N. peacekeepers.      And the United Nations Security Council will meet next week to discuss whether to recommend a new member state's entry into the global body.      Peter Wittig, the U.N. ambassador of Germany, which holds the rotating Security Council presidency this month, said council members will meet July 13 to talk about U.N. admission. If granted, South Sudan would become the first state since Montenegro in 2006 to become a U.N. member.

Dr. Michael Newman said medics tried to revive Tim Russert several times before he died.    Dr. Michael Newman told CNN's Larry King that a defibrillator, a heart-shocking device, was used to try to save Russert. \"A resuscitation was begun almost immediately,\" he said.    Russert, a mainstay of television journalism's political talk as the host of \"Meet the Press,\" died of a heart attack after collapsing at NBC's Washington bureau Friday. He was 58.    Newman appeared on \"Larry King Live\" on Monday, along with Dr. Mehmet Oz, a cardiac thoracic surgeon, and Dr. P.K. Shah, King's heart doctor.  Watch Russert's son greet guests at wake \u00bb    Newman described Russert as a model patient: \"He complied with almost everything that was asked of him.\"    The following is an edited version of the show's transcript:    Newman: Tim had a cardiac arrest. It was related to an acute -- presumably acute dissection, rupturing plaque that's causing a blockage of a coronary artery. He had a heart attack -- a fatal arrhythmia.  Watch panel discuss if Russert's death was preventable \u00bb    King: Did we know he had heart disease?    Newman: Tim was known to have coronary artery disease, and it was being treated with respect to management of his risk factors.    King: Was he on medication? Did he exercise? Did he watch what he ate?    Newman: Tim was on medication. I'd like to say, I'm glad you mentioned exercise and watching what we eat. The foundation of management of heart disease and every medical condition, really, starts with lifestyle modification. You know, a healthy lifestyle, and you'll have good health, and you'll certainly have a healthy heart. ...    Tim appreciated that. Yes, he exercised. He was on his Aerodyne bicycle.  See a timeline of Russert's career \u00bb    King: Dr. Oz, from what Dr. Newman said, could it have been prevented?    Oz: You can never tell for sure. And the reality is a big wake-up call. And it's the question that Tim Russert would be asking right now: What are the odds that I could have done something different myself?    Let's examine it for a second. Of the 450,000 people a year who die of heart attacks in this country, probably half of them never knew they were at risk of a heart attack.    It's because the heart doesn't really have pain fibers. In fact, the only reason you ever feel any pain when you're having a heart attack is because the nerves in the heart cross other nerves -- from your chin, your arm or from the chest and the spinal column. And they short-circuit each other out. And that creates this referred pain that in cardiology and cardiosurgery we recognize to be angina.    The other reality -- and this is a big wake-up call for a lot of Americans, as well -- is that a lot of the plaques that we have are not flow limiting. And by that I mean they don't cause a limitation on the amount of blood that courses through the veins that go to our heart. ...    King: Dr. Shah has brought along a defibrillator. Right? Dr. Newman, it was not used, is that correct?    Newman: That's not correct.    King: OK, it was used.    Newman: NBC had a defibrillator. A resuscitation was begun almost immediately. NBC had an EAD [external automated defibrillator] on site, and they were preparing to use it. At the same moment, the DC EMS, emergency medical squad, arrived, and they immediately defibrillated Tim. He had no heart rhythm. They defibrillated him. His heart was beating then in a ventricular -- fine ventricular fib, and then it deteriorated. They shocked him again. Actually, he was defibrillated three times before his arrival at Sibley Memorial Hospital.  Remembering Tim Russert \u00bb    King: Why do you think it didn't work in the Russert case?    Shah: There are several possibilities. The longer the delay between the time collapse occurs and you begin defibrillation, the less the success of defibrillation. That's number one. Number two, if you're a very big-sized individual and have a large heart, the larger the heart, the harder it is to get a successful defibrillation. The bigger the heart, the more likely you are to go back into fibrillation.    King: Dr. Newman, was Tim Russert a good patient?    Newman: Tim was a great patient. Tim Russert as a patient was the Tim Russert that we all know. He complied with almost everything that was asked of him. He was well-informed, asked good questions. Tim was a good patient. Are there things all of us as patients could be better at? Sure. But Tim was a good patient.    King: Do you ever think, Dr. Newman, in retrospect, I could have done more? Should have done more?    Newman: You know, as physicians, we always hope that we can change people's lives, that we can make them feel better, live longer, that we can intervene, and that's what our role is. Unfortunately, in many instances, our hopes are not fulfilled. Absolutely, I wish Tim was alive and with us today. ... And ... patients die of heart disease or cancer; we all struggle with the fact there are limits to what we can do."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a245ada6d3e792444dd288ef8befa1f1391c4636.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who opposes President Obama's fiscal policies?", "id": "107995", "answers": [{"text": "Republican Scott Brown", "answer_start": 20}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Republican Scott Brown was sworn in Thursday as the new U.S. senator from Massachusetts to fill the seat formerly held by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, and immediately signaled opposition to President Obama's spending plans.      Brown's new Senate colleagues applauded after the ceremony on the floor of the Senate chamber conducted by Vice President Joe Biden, in his capacity as president of the Senate. Democratic Sen. John Kerry, also of Massachusetts, and Brown's wife, Gail Huff, accompanied Brown into the chamber.      At a news conference after the ceremony, Brown thanked Massachusetts voters who gave him a surprise victory in the January 19 special election in a state that had not elected a Republican senator since 1972.      \"I can't promise I'll be right in every vote I make. I'm sure I'll make mistakes from time to time,\" Brown said. \"But I will try to learn and grow and do the very best job I can on a day-to-day basis.\"      Brown's election victory stripped Senate Democrats of their 60-seat Senate supermajority, imperiling the ability of Obama and Democrats to push major legislative priorities such as health care reform through Congress.      The Republican upset in Massachusetts also raised fears among many congressional Democrats of a potential GOP landslide in November's midterm elections.      A fiscal conservative who holds some moderate views, Brown was noncommittal on whether he would support a Republican filibuster in coming Senate consideration of some Obama nominees for government posts.      He also said he needed to talk to generals in the field before deciding to support Obama's call, supported by top military leaders, to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy regarding a ban on gays in the military.      Brown made clear he opposes the spending policies of the Obama administration, stating that the $862 billion stimulus bill passed last year \"didn't create one new job\" in Massachusetts or across the country. He also said Congress should start over on health care with bipartisan talks, instead of continuing work on separate comprehensive bills passed by the House and Senate.      That prompted a response later from Jay Carney, spokesman for Biden, who said, \"Anyone can go to recovery.gov (on the Internet) and see that Massachusetts state and local government, businesses and community organizations have already reported directly funding over 9,000 jobs in the state last year -- and that's based on a only a portion of the total $8.4 billion in (stimulus) funds that have already gone to Massachusetts.\"      He also said Congress should start over on health care with bipartisan talks, instead of continuing work on separate comprehensive bills passed by the House and Senate.      At the same time, Brown said he would consider each piece of legislation on merit, rather than whether it was proposed by one party or another.      \"If I see a bill that's good for my state first, I don't care where it comes from,\" Brown said. \"If it's good for Massachusetts, I'll consider it.\"      Thursday's ceremony occurred a week earlier than originally planned.      Massachusetts officials had said it would take a few weeks after the election to certify the result of Brown's victory. In a letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Secretary of State William Galvin on Wednesday, Brown's attorney said the senator-elect had planned on being sworn in on February 11, but had been told that several Senate votes would be held before then.      \"For this reason, he wants certification to occur immediately,\" attorney Daniel Winslow wrote.      The certification occurred Thursday, allowing Brown to officially fill his seat later in the day.      \"There's no hidden agenda,\" Brown said of his push to get certified this week instead of next. \"It's because I want to get to work.\"      Asked why his daughters didn't attend the swearing-in, Brown explained one of them, Ayla, had a college basketball game to play Thursday and the other, Arianna, had a college exam.      \"The Bibles I used for today's swearing-in belong to my daughters, and I stacked them one on top of the other and took my oath on them,\" Brown said.      Brown will be taking over Kennedy's coveted office space in the Senate Russell building. Sen. Paul Kirk, who was appointed to fill the seat after Kennedy's death, currently occupies the office and will move out.      Several Senate sources tell CNN that the Senate Rules Committee, which assigns office space, decided to give Brown the office space as a matter of convenience.      Because of his seniority, Kennedy had one of the most coveted office suites in the Senate complex. It is located in the Russell building, down the hall from the Rotunda, and has balconies that overlook the Capitol.

The tsunami wave hit right in the middle of the harbor of Pago Pago, the capital.    American Samoa Gov. Togiola Tulafono, speaking from Hawaii, said Tuesday's quake ranked \"right up there with some of the worst\" disasters on the island. He said about 50 people had been treated for injuries so far but he expected that number to rise.    The quake hit the small cluster of South Pacific islands early Tuesday morning. By evening, Laumoli, standing outside the LBJ Tropical Medican Center morgue in the capital of Pago Pago, confirmed 22 deaths.    \"I thought it was the end of the world,\" said Dr. Salamo Laumoli, director of health services. \"I have never felt an earthquake like that before.\"    Laumoli feared more fatalities would turn up as rescue workers were still trying to access parts of the island severed by damaged infrastructure.    Laumoli said people in outlying villages on one end of the main island have been cut off because the main bridge was washed away.    \"Two or three villages have been badly damaged,\" he told CNN International.  Listen to Laumoli speak about the impact of the quake and tsunami \u00bb    Tulafono cited extensive damage to roads, buildings and homes, and said he had spoken to the military about mobilizing reserve forces for assistance.    The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, canceled tsunami watches and warnings for American Samoa about four hours after the earthquake hit. However, a tsunami advisory is still in effect for for the coastal areas of California and Oregon.  Watch report on end of tsunami warning \u00bb    The Japan Meteorological Agency also activated a tsunami advisory along its eastern coast. The precautionary alert means that the height of a possible tsunami wave would be less than a foot and a half.    President Barack Obama \"declared a major disaster exists in the Territory of American Samoa\" late Tuesday and ordered federal aid to supplement local efforts. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals.    The tsunami waves hit right in the middle of the Pago Pago harbor, the capital, said Cinta Brown, an American Samoa homeland security official working at the island's emergency operations center. The water devastated the village of Leone.  Watch a resident talk about what happened \u00bb    \"The wave came onshore and washed out people's homes,\" Brown said.    The same happened on the hard-hit east and west sides of American Samoa, she said.    The quake generated three separate tsunami waves, the largest measuring 5.1 feet from sea level height, said Vindell Hsu, a geophysicist with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Preliminary data had originally reported a larger tsunami.    Officials in the U.S. territory issued a clear call and were focusing on assessing the damage, Brown said.    Reports of damage were still emerging, but a bulletin from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the waves \"may have been destructive along coasts near the earthquake epicenter and could also be a threat to more distant coasts. Authorities should take appropriate action in response to this possibility.\"    Tulafono, the governor, was on his way back home Tuesday night on one of two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 transport planes flying to American Samoa with aid.    The Coast Guard also will transport more than 20 officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to American Samoa, said John Hamill, external affairs officer for FEMA in Oakland, California.    The FEMA team will include a variety of debris experts, housing experts, members of the Corps of Engineers, and other disaster relief specialists, Hamill said.

He is president of Feehery Group, a Washington-based advocacy firm that has represented clients that include News Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America.    John Feehery says he's proud Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, but now the president needs to earn it.    WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Usually, when a president wins the Nobel Peace Prize, it is uniformly seen as a positive development for America and for the world.    Both opponents and allies tend to celebrate the fact that an American president actually got recognized by a bunch of Norwegians for something he achieved.    But with Barack Obama, who surprisingly picked up his first Nobel Prize on Friday, the reaction was not altogether positive from either the left or the right.    You would expect that conservatives would raise questions about the president's award. Conservatives raise questions about everything the president does.    But liberals also joined in. Mickey Kaus of Slate said that the president should say thanks, but no thanks. \"Turn it down! Politely decline. Say he's honored but he hasn't had the time yet to accomplish what he wants to accomplish.\" Liberal columnist Richard Cohen wrote a mocking column, comparing Obama's award to a fictional award given to Sarah Palin for promising to \"read a book someday.\"    We are all glad that Norway loves Obama, but come on. Let's get serious.    I am reminded of when Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf decided to retire the jersey of longtime White Sox player Harold Baines. It was a little premature for Baines to get his uniform retired when he himself was playing for another team. (Baines played a couple more years, surely the only instance where a player's uniform was retired before the player was.)    Awarding Obama the Nobel Peace Prize is similarly premature. In fact, the White House seemed as surprised as anybody about the gesture. I imagine that when Obama first picked up the line, he thought it was a crank call.    \"I won what?\" he must have exclaimed.    But it is no joke. It seems that President Obama won his first Nobel Peace Prize, for, well, being President Obama.    Just the very idea of a President Obama is enough to make the Nobel Selection Committee swoon.    The president said he was humbled by this award. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, he has much to be humble about.    When it comes to peace, it is hard to see what notable accomplishments have been achieved thus far in the Obama presidency. That is not a slap at him. Peace takes time.    It took John Hume and David Trimble about 30 years of really hard and dangerous work in Northern Ireland before they got a Nobel Peace Prize. And despite all of that hard work, peace and reconciliation is still elusive in that region.    Mr. Obama hasn't even been able to get a peace deal between Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, who continue to snipe at each other over the health care public option and Afghanistan.    Peace hasn't exactly broken out in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, or Iran either.    Nobel Prizes usually go for some fairly notable accomplishments.    Nelson Mandela spent much of his life protesting apartheid and serving a prison sentence. He is a man who deserved a peace prize.    Mikhail Gorbachev allowed the Soviet Union to collapse without much of a whimper. That was an accomplishment that deserved a peace prize.    But what exactly has President Obama done to deserve such an award? And if he actually does something in the future, does that mean he gets another one?    Apparently, the voting on the peace prize started shortly after the president was sworn in. Perhaps he is getting the peace prize because of his inaugural address. Yep, a lot of people came to that speech, and peace mostly reigned on that day (except for those people with tickets to the Inauguration who got stuck in the \"purple tunnel\" in Washington). But I don't think he deserves a peace prize for that.    I guess he got the prize because he was elected president and he wasn't George Bush. Well, if that is the case, maybe all of those millions of Americans who voted for him should share the prize, because they actually did most of the work. They voted.    As an American, I am proud that our president was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize.    Now, I, like many others on the right and the left, would like to see him do something to earn it.    The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/3b2021837521fc9da67b99f6d3b77441994c0c94.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How far from shore did the ferry sink?", "id": "108008", "answers": [{"text": "12 nautical miles", "answer_start": 498}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The body of a tourist was found off the coast of Thailand Tuesday, but six others remain missing after a ferry sank over the weekend near a popular diving destination, authorities said.

Baby albatross on a remote Atlantic island are threatened by killer house mice.    The research from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds indicates bad news for the Tristan albatross, whose only home is Gough Island in the middle of the south Atlantic. House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said.    The mice are also threatening the native population of bunting, one of the world's largest finches, the RSPB said.    \"Without removal of the mice, both the albatross and the bunting that live there are doomed to extinction,\" Grahame Madge, a conservation spokesman for the RSPB, told CNN.    The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said. This makes it especially difficult for the albatross population to survive because the birds lay eggs only once every two years -- a very low reproductive rate compared to other birds, Madge said.    \"What [the mice] are affecting is the ability of the albatross to produce enough young to sustain the population,\" he said.    Adult Tristan albatross are threatened by longline fishing at sea, a practice in which boats put up numerous 100-meter long fishing lines baited with squid or fish. The albatrosses are attracted to the bait and while some manage to steal it successfully, many more get snagged and drown, Madge said.    Because of the impact from house mice, introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction.    Gough Island, a British territory almost midway between Argentina and South Africa, is a place of stunning natural beauty.    The island is not inhabited by humans. Gough Island and nearby Inaccessible Island are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites.    A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs, the RSPB said. A later survey revealed only 246 chicks had survived to fledgling.    \"We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers,\" said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem. \"However, we now know that the albatrosses have suffered their worst year on record.\"    The bunting suffer because the mice eat their eggs and chicks, and may also compete with them for food in the winter, Cuthbert said.    \"The decline in bunting numbers is alarming,\" said Peter Ryan of the University of Cape Town, who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s. \"Without urgent conservation action to remove the mice, both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time.\"    The RSPB has been studying whether it is possible to remove the mice. It said trials so far look promising, but it urged the British government to step up funding for the project. It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species.    The RSPB said it had been working with New Zealand conservationists on a program to remove the smaller mice by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters.    Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world. Albatrosses principally live in the southern Atlantic but some also live in the Pacific, the RSPB says.    Albatrosses are among the largest flying birds, weighing up to 25 pounds (22.5 kilograms). One species -- the wandering albatross -- has a wingspan of 11 feet, the RSPB says.    The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/75e6c61d7fb9388bf5dc9faa4cbe963801625aec.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why did he say that Polaroid's bankruptcy was necessary?", "id": "108016", "answers": [{"text": "because of an investigation of its parent company,", "answer_start": 716}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Polaroid Corp. announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year.  Hapag-Lloyd Cruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the MS Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at an undisclosed port, then fly to Dubai to continue their journey.  The company called the move a precautionary measure.  Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staging increasingly bolder attacks on ever-bigger targets. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  Freight and cargo ships, cruise liners, and private yachts have all come under attack. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom.  The problem has forced companies like Hapag-Lloyd, that use the Gulf of Aden, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes.  One shipping company announced last month it would bypass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Cape of Good Hope and adding thousands of kilometers to its voyages.  Read more about how to solve the pirate problem here.  Hapag-Lloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down.  Representatives of Hapag-Lloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment.  The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Dubai on December 17, according to Hapag-Lloyd's Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Bali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia.  Hapag-Lloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Aden with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Dubai for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back onboard, the company said.  Both the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, Hapag-Lloyd said.  The U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks.  Last week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships \"to apply a robust and layered protective security regime\" when traveling through the area.  -- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/79a421182db411a0feda92ea3b570491f1723a69.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What do experts say about toxic dumping?", "id": "108024", "answers": [{"text": "chemicals did not harm anyone.", "answer_start": 459}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- A global commodities trading company says it is considering a settlement to legal claims that it is responsible for the deaths of 15 people and thousands of illnesses after 500 tons of toxic waste were dumped in the African nation of Ivory Coast.    Signs such as this were still up in \"toxic zones\" around Abidjan, Ivory Coast, a year after the waste dumping.    The Dutch company Trafigura said studies by 20 experts it has hired conclude that the chemicals did not harm anyone.    \"In view of that expert evidence, and the fact that claims are not being made in this litigation for deaths, miscarriages, still births, birth defects and other serious injuries, the parties are exploring the possibility of compromising the claims which have been made,\" Trafigura said in a release Wednesday. \"A global settlement is being considered by the parties and it currently appears that this settlement is likely to be acceptable to most, if not all, of the claimants.\"    A United Nations report also released Wednesday said Trafigura did cause death and injury when the cargo ship Probo Koala dumped 500 tons of toxic waste belonging to the company at sites around Abidjan, the West African nation's largest city. The incident happened in August 2006.    \"According to official estimates, 15 people died, 69 people were hospitalized and over 100,000 others, complaining of nausea and vomiting after inhaling fumes, sought medical treatment after the incident,\" said the report by Okechukwu Ibeanu, an unpaid investigator for the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council.    \"We still don't know -- and we may never know -- the full effect of the dumping. But there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping of the waste.\"    Ibeanu, who visited Ivory Coast and the Netherlands during his investigation, urged all parties to take steps \"to address possible long-term human health and environmental effects of the incident.\"    According to a U.N. statement, Ibeanu said last month that the areas where the toxic waste was dumped still have not been decontaminated and continue to threaten residents' health. Many people, he said, are still reporting headaches, skin lesions, digestive difficulties and nose, throat and lung problems.    Trafigura noted in its release Wednesday that it initiated a plan two years ago that would compensate, without any admission of liability, any claimants who could demonstrate any injury caused by exposure to the waste, which the company calls \"slops.\"    \"The company has always maintained that the Probo Koala's slops could not possibly have caused deaths and serious or long-term injuries,\" Trafigura said. \"Independent expert witnesses firmly support Trafigura in this stance.\"    Trafigura also maintains it \"sought to comply with all relevant regulations and procedures concerning the offloading of the Probo Koala's slops in Abidjan.\"    The company denies that the ship went to Ivory Coast solely to dump the toxic waste.    \"Trafigura has consistently stated that the Probo Koala was returning from a routine commercial voyage to deliver a gasoline cargo in Lagos, Nigeria, when it stopped in Abidjan,\" the company statement said. \"Consequently, any suggestion that the vessel was sent to West Africa solely for the purpose of offloading its slops is entirely inaccurate.\"    As one of the largest independent companies trading commodities, Trafigura has 1,900 employees in 42 nations, the company's Web site says.    \"We handle every element involved in the sourcing and trading of crude oil, petroleum products, renewable energies, metals, metal ores and concentrates for industrial consumers.\" the company says.

Instead, angry Haitians, some of them on motorbikes, ended up attacking the 11 American missionaries when they tried to flee this city aboard a big, yellow bus.      \"We almost made it out of town,\" team member Kerry Gibson told CNN in a phone call after his team survived the attack unharmed.      Until Wednesday morning, Gibson and his fellow volunteers had been holed up in a hotel on a hilltop overlooking Cap-Haitien, after demonstrators put up networks of barricades through the streets and began attacking the bases of United Nations peacekeepers with rocks, bottles and petrol bombs. The demonstrators have accused peacekeepers of starting the cholera outbreak.      The motorcyclist team is part of an American organization that has hundreds of branches across the country.      One of its goals, Gibson said, is to donate motorcycles to Christian leaders.      \"We put wheels under indigenous local pastors,\" Gibson explained.  \"We were presenting seven here in Cap-Haitien. Obviously, that won't happen now.\"      Given the violence that has led to the death of at least one protester, the team decided Wednesday to cut their trip to Haiti short by a week.  A Haitian pastor informed Gibson that the road out of town was open, so the missionaries climbed aboard a commercial bus and tried to make it into nearby Dominican Republic.      But on the outskirts of Cap-Haitien, the bus suddenly ran into trouble. \"We saw one guy with a machete raised up and he's running and yelling and screaming and pointing up ahead.  We suspect they put a blockade up in front of us.  That's when we stopped and they busted out the glass on the door,\" Gibson recalled.      \"Our driver, he was like a NASCAR driver.

The bus was incapacitated and started spraying oil.  At some point, demonstrators dragged a Haitian employee of the bus company out of the vehicle and began beating him.      Gibson said the driver then maneuvered the bus onto the sidewalk and lurched the vehicle forward toward the gate of a nearby U.N. peacekeeping base. \"I feel like God protected us,\" Gibson said. \"Just the fact that the bus stopped, died right in front of the U.N. compound, is confirmation that he's looking out for us.\"      Peacekeepers from Chile opened the gate and ushered the bus and its passengers inside the compound.      The 11 CMA representatives were preparing to spend the night with the Chilean military and pondering their next step for escaping Cap-Haitien.      Gibson insisted that, throughout the adrenaline-packed attack on the bus, he never felt he was in danger.      The man who was dragged off the bus escaped without serious injury, Gibson said.  \"Of course it's a nerve-wracking situation, but I never got the impression that there was any real effort to do physical harm to us.\"      Asked what he planned to do Thursday, he said, \"Pray a lot.\"      Journalist Dmitri Fourcand contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/23ae06eb107634f7969139f3c0696757772d4b68.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does the tourist attraction do?", "id": "108027", "answers": [{"text": "offering visitors the chance to curse former boyfriends, girlfriends or spouses", "answer_start": 138}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Love hurts, especially for jilted lovers on Valentine's Day.

Bush said he is making the change since President Ra\u00fal Castro \"is allowing Cubans to own mobile phones for the first time.\"    \"If he is serious about his so-called reforms, he will allow these phones to reach the Cuban people,\" Bush said.    Bush urged the Cuban government to loosen restrictions further, saying if Cubans can be allowed to own mobile phones, \"they should be trusted to speak freely in public.\"    They should be allowed to watch uncensored movies and have free access to the Internet, he said.    And he called for the government to implement major free-market reforms.    Relations between the United States and Cuba remain tense nearly 50 years after Fidel Castro overthrew the pro-American government in Havana. The United States has maintained an embargo against Cuba for decades.    Cuban officials on Monday accused the top U.S. diplomat in Havana of delivering money from private anti-Castro groups in Florida to dissidents in Cuba.    U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that \"the U.S. government has programs to provide humanitarian assistance to people that are essentially forgotten by the Cuban government and that we ... do not stand in the way of private groups doing that as well.\"    As to how that is done, he said, \"I'm not aware of the mechanics; I don't steep myself in these things.\"    Fidel Castro, beset with health problems, handed day-to-day governing power over to Ra\u00fal, his younger brother, earlier this year.

The goods and services remain out of reach for most people on the island, where $120 cell phones plus $10.80 calling cards cost about six times the average monthly salary.    Bush said Wednesday it is \"the height of hypocrisy to claim credit to allow Cubans to purchase appliances that virtually none of them can afford.\"    Though the price may put mobile phones out of the reach of most Cubans, they are affordable for many of those who have access to U.S. dollars -- typically either sent from relatives abroad or earned internally by tourist workers.

To the casual observer all tires look the same, but there's a lot more to it than meets the eye ...    There are many different tire designs and they may contain up to 200 raw materials.    Modern tire construction has allowed for a degree of handling, ride comfort, traction, extended treadwear and fuel economy that far exceeds the tires of just a few years ago.    Today there are tire designs that contain up to 200 raw materials, as well as complex architecture of steel belts, textile piles and computer designed tread patterns, which deliver maximum traction under all conditions.    Each component of a tire is designed to perform its own function and to work together with the rest of the components. For instance, the belt system's job is to provide stability to the tread area, keep the tread grooves open, and work as a unit with the sidewalls to provide stability in cornering and handling. Kind of reminds me of the old song, \"The toe bone's connected to the foot bone\" well ... you get the picture, right?    The major component in tires is rubber. How did this substance find its way into the American automobile tire? As with most inventions, this is a fascinating story.    Rubber by itself is a gooey substance that is extremely sensitive to temperature. Back in the early 1830's \"rubber fever\" was the craze, and it ended as quickly as it started. At first, everybody wanted things made of this new waterproof gum from Brazil, and factories sprung up to meet the demand.    Then abruptly, the public became fed up with the messy stuff that froze bone-hard in winter and turned glue-like in summer. Not one of the young rubber companies survived as long as five years. Investors lost millions and everyone agreed that rubber had seen its hay-day in America. AOL Autos: Best car deals of the month    Then Charles Goodyear stepped up to the plate. Through extensive experimentation and persistence, Goodyear found that rubber could be stabilized and formed into a useful compound by adding sulfur and applying heat. He found that steam under pressure, applied to the compound for 4 to 6 hours at about 270 degrees Fahrenheit, gave him the most uniform results. This was the beginning of rubber compounds! AOL Autos: Most popular sedans    Rubber compounding is like mixing a cake. Different ingredients are mixed together at different degrees to produce rubber with specific characteristics. Some rubber compounds are stickier for better traction when racing. Some compounds are much harder for heavy-duty work in construction or with heavy equipment. All-season rubber for all-season tires is rubber that doesn't freeze below thirty-two degrees, allowing for movement of the tread in the cold weather so it will grip and give maximum traction in all weather. AOL Autos: Best-selling hybrid cars    Ever wonder how a steel belted radial tire is constructed? Check this out.    1. First comes the construction of the casing. This is the body (or carcass) of the tire ... the \"foundation\" upon which everything is built. The casing is made up of a series of cords (most typically polyester) which are combined to form layers or piles. These layers are connected to two circular strands of steel called beads. Then the inner liner is added, serving as the air seal. Once the casing is formed, everything else is added to make up the tire. AOL Autos: Consumer reports picks best used luxury cars    2. Next comes the steel belt. This is a belt made up of woven steel strands that cover the casing of the tire and is located directly under the tread. The steel belt adds strength and durability, aids in keeping the tread grooves open for maximum traction, and protects the casing against impacts and punctures. On high performance tires an extra belt is usually added for strength; this is a nylon overlay that is wrapped around the whole steel belt package. As the tire rolls faster it heats up. The nylon in turn heats up and tends to shrink, counteracting the natural tendency of centrifugal force to throw the whole thing apart at high speeds. AOL Autos: Cars with best Blue Book resale value    3. Finally, the tread is added. Remember that this rubber compound is a special mix for a specific application and varies depending on the function of the tire. In this day and age, computers play a big role in the tread designs. Tread designs are tested for traction in \"virtual reality\" before they are molded into the rubber.    While tread designs vary greatly, there are consistent elements present in all tread patterns. The tread block grips at its leading and trailing edge. Within each block, sipes are often molded or cut to provide additional traction. These sipes segment the block and allow for movement of each individual block so that when it comes in contact with the pavement, it opens and closes causing a squeegee (or pumping) action, cleaning the road surface as it rolls along. The grooves built into the tread pattern are designed to channel away weather elements such as water, snow, slush, and mud.    To illustrate how a tread design channels away water, just pour water over the tread of the tire and watch the water directed right out of the sides of the tire. On the outside edges of the tires \"shoulder lugs\" are molded into the tread. These heavy segments provide protection as well as additional traction during hard cornering.    A final note and credit to Charles Goodyear. He didn't just happen upon this discovery of rubber compounding and the use of heat. Goodyear spent five miserable years in poverty trying to perfect his idea. Then one day, it happened... the great discovery came in the winter of 1839. As stated earlier, Goodyear was using sulfur in his experiments. Although Goodyear himself has left the details in doubt, the most persistent story goes as follows.    One February day, Goodyear wandered into Woburn's general store to show off his latest gum-and-sulfur formula. Snickers rose from the cracker-barrel forum, and the usually mild-mannered little inventor got excited and waved his sticky fistful of gum in the air. It flew from his fingers and landed on the sizzling-hot potbellied stove.    When he bent to scrape it off, he found that instead of melting like molasses, it had charred like leather. And around the charred area was a dry, springy brown rim -- \"gum elastic\" still, but so remarkably altered that it was virtually a new substance. He had made weatherproof rubber!    This discovery is often cited as one of history's most celebrated \"accidents.\" Goodyear stoutly denied that. Like Newton's falling apple, he maintained, the hot stove incident held meaning only for the man \"whose mind was prepared to draw an inference.\" That meant, he added simply, the one who had \"applied himself most perseveringly to the subject.\" Thanks for your perseverance Charlie.

Also, an Iranian official said claims by the United States that a high-level U.S. diplomat had met Wednesday with an Iranian counterpart over the plot were untrue.      \"There were no kinds of negotiations between the two countries, and there was not such a contact,\" said Alireza Miryousefi, press secretary for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations.      The United States had reported having had \"direct contact with Iran\" about the alleged plot.      State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland disclosed the contact to reporters. A senior administration official told CNN it occurred Wednesday and was initiated by the United States.      Two State Department officials said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice met with Mohammad Khazai, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations.      Ahead of Saturday's rebuttal of the claims of diplomatic contact, Iranian officials had previously declined to confirm the meeting.      U.S. authorities have accused Iran of being involved in a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, Adel Al-Jubeir, in spring 2012.      The alleged scheme involved a connection to the Quds Force, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, which formally answers to Khamenei.      Manssor Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, are accused of conspiring to hire hit men from a Mexican drug cartel to bomb a restaurant, where the ambassador would have been.      Authorities developed the case against the suspects with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a Mexican drug cartel, according to officials and an FBI agent's affidavit.      Reza Aslan, a religious scholar and author, told CNN on Saturday that the described plot \"just does not fit the Quds Force's M.O.

At the ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to seal the transition deal worked out by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saleh seemed relaxed and even chuckled as he signed several copies of the agreement, the result of intense diplomatic shuttling by U.N. envoy Jamal bin Omar and growing pressure from the international community.      But Saleh also took a parting shot at his opponents, saying they had destroyed in months everything that had been built over years.      April Longley Alley, Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, says the Riyadh deal offers an \"opportunity to move past the current political impasse and to deal with critical issues like deteriorating economic and humanitarian conditions as well as the very difficult task of institutional reform.\"      Even so, Longley Alley and other analysts expect the epilogue to be anything but predictable. There are plenty of competing elements left behind: the thousands of mainly young demonstrators who took to the streets of Sanaa and other cities in January to demand democratic change, the tribal alliance that took up arms against Saleh, secessionists in the south and a Shiite rebellion in the north, well-organized Islamist groups and a budding al Qaeda franchise.      Perhaps the most powerful figure in Yemen now is Brig. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, commander of the 1st Armored Division. He defected in March and took a chunk of the army with him. His units now control northern districts of the capital and are facing off against powerful remnants of the Saleh clan. The president's son, Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, long groomed to be his successor, and his nephew, Yahya Muhammad Saleh, command the most effective units.      Longley Alley says the Gulf Cooperation Council accord \"does not deal effectively with lingering tensions between Saleh's family on one hand and Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar and the powerful al-Ahmar family on the other. Each of these power centers is heavily armed and still poised to fight.\"      As if to remind the diplomats of the scale of the task ahead, pro- and anti-Saleh factions clashed in Sanaa hours before the ceremony. The challenge of \"securing a cease-fire, removing armed tribesmen from urban centers, returning the military to the barracks and engaging in military-security reform will be serious stumbling blocks post-signing,\" according to Longley Alley.      Al-Ahmar makes some Western officials nervous because of his links with radical Sunni Islamists. Yemeni observers say the Muslim Brotherhood has long been influential within al-Ahmar's military command, and he is known for his antipathy toward Yemen's Shiites. A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2005 said that \"Ali Mohsen's questionable dealings with terrorists and extremists would make his accession unwelcome to the U.S. and others in the international community.\"      Others in this powerful clan include Hamid al-Ahmar, a leader of the Islamist party Islah and a prominent businessman who has long been an opponent of the president. His brother Sadiq also has armed supporters in and around Sanaa.      For generations, the Yemeni state has done little without the al-Ahmars' blessing. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Hussein al-Ahmar, who died in 2007, was one of the few Yemenis to command widespread respect -- a man often described as the father of modern Yemen. He was an opposition leader but also speaker of the Parliament, and Saleh was careful not to cross him. Today, there seems no one of similar stature.      The tens of thousands of demonstrators who have braved gunfire, tear gas and pro-government gangs in Sanaa, Taiz and elsewhere are unlikely to be satisfied by Saleh's departure. They fear being marginalized by the transfer of power from one clique to another as part of some \"tribal bargain\" and oppose Saleh's immunity from prosecution, which is part of the Riyadh deal.      But Longley Alley says they have a role to play. \"The independent youth in Yemen have at times been marginalized by the armed conflict. While these young people do not have guns or butter, they are beginning to organize and to recognize their potential influence.\"      Others who may play a significant role include the cleric Abdul Majid al-Zindani, who heads the Salafist (very conservative) wing of the Islah party. He is feared by liberal Yemenis.      But ultimately, as one U.S. diplomatic cable sent from Sanaa in 2005 put it, \"True power still derives from the military and the tribes.\"      As for the 69-year old Saleh himself, a combination of factors probably led him to choose this moment to sign away his powers. He still needs medical treatment for the burns sustained in an attack on the Presidential Palace in June -- injuries that left him in a Saudi hospital for three months. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Saleh told him he would be traveling to New York for treatment soon.      Another possible reason is that Saleh has seen the violent end of Moammar Gadhafi and growing pressure on Bashar al-Assad in Syria. He also has been subject to intense diplomatic pressure by Saudi Arabia and the United Nations finally to ratify the Gulf Cooperation Council deal. The European Union had begun considering sanctions. And military units loyal to the president have lost ground in recent weeks.      But what are his plans now? No one has the definitive answer. The intrigue is reminiscent of the Congress of Vienna in 1815 that drew the post-Napoleonic map of Europe. When the Russian envoy died suddenly, Austria's Prince Metternich is reputed to have said: \"I wonder what his motive was.\"      Whatever power structure emerges, Yemen's next leaders will face daunting tasks as they inherit a state where oil revenues have declined and the economy is in ruins, where poverty is endemic and a young and rapidly growing population faces a chronic shortage of water. Not to mention the percolating rebellions in the south and north, and a well-entrenched affiliate of al Qaeda.      To recall a line from Hamlet that might well apply to Yemen today:      \"When sorrows come, they come not single spies,      \"But in battalions.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/d31eea81a96e05ae01e40dbd84ed7af9937f1204.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How much was England bowled out for?", "id": "108044", "answers": [{"text": "241-7.", "answer_start": 501}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Captain Graeme Smith ground out a potentially match-winning century to put South Africa on top in the third cricket Test against England at Newlands on Tuesday.    The left-hander was unbeaten on 162 at stumps on the third day, having added a record 230 for the second wicket with Hashim Amla (95) as the home side reached 312-2 in Cape Town's intense heat.    England struggled from the outset, losing two wickets in the day's opening over and added just 32 runs to their overnight total of 241-7.    That gave the Proteas a first-innings lead of 18 runs, and it looked like the home side might also find batting difficult when makeshift opener Ashwell Prince continued his miserable series, falling leg before wicket to spinner Graeme Swann for 15.    But Smith and Amla set about the English attack, who gained no profit from a controversial incident when seamer Chris Broad stood on the ball with his studded boots before lunch when it was still relatively new.    Smith survived a series of close calls and decision referrals as the duo set a new Test highest mark for the second wicket at the venue.    The opener thought he was out soon after reaching his 19th century in the five-day format, but England wicketkeeper Matt Prior admitted that the edge off seamer Graham Onions had not carried.    Amla finally fell to a bat-pad catch by Alistair Cook off Swann, falling five runs short of his eighth Test ton as he hit 14 boundaries off 156 deliveries.    First-innings centurion Jacques Kallis was unbeaten on 20 at stumps, with Smith having plundered 22 boundaries in his 243 balls at the crease.    Earlier, Morne Morkel (5-75) took two wickets in two balls to put England on the back foot, with Swann caught at slip by Smith for five from a fierce rising delivery and James Anderson following in identical fashion.    Prior, who was 52 overnight, hit out to get England close to parity before dragging a short ball from Dale Steyn (4-74) onto his wicket to be last out for 76.    England coach Andy Flower said Wednesday's morning session would prove vital for his side, who lead 1-0 after winning the second Test.    \"We have got to attack with the new ball. We have seen wickets fall early on all the days so far. We have definitely got to attack early,\" the former Zimbabwe international player said.    \"The first two days produced very difficult batting conditions, today was easier.

A 5.9-magnitude aftershock Wednesday had given her new patients.      Even though Garner was trying to figure out how to get home, he still kept tending to patients being brought to a landing zone in three private helicopters.      Those helicopters belong to Utah businessman Jeremy Johnson, who offered to take a medical team to Haiti after last week's 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed tens of thousands and injured thousands more.      Garner was a last-minute addition to a team put together by financial adviser Craig Nelson, a neighbor in Utah.      Nelson had been to Haiti on a Mormon mission 20 years ago, along with Steve Hansen and Chuck Peterson, now both Utah physicians. When Nelson heard about the earthquake, he decided they needed to go. Hansen and Peterson readily agreed.      They were dropped off Monday at the coastal city of Leogane, nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of Port-au-Prince. The city was at the epicenter of last week's earthquake, and some reports say up to 90 percent of Leogane's buildings were damaged or destroyed.      Impact Your World      The U.S. doctors were among the first caregivers to arrive and were later joined by teams from Cuba, Germany, Canada and other nations.

Search parties continue their operation to locate the Yemenia Airbus A310 off the Comoros Islands Saturday.    \"A signal was picked up from two acoustic transmitters from the plane's flight data recorders during a sea search to locate the data recorders this morning,\" the French air accident investigation agency, known as the BEA, said in a statement.    Commonly known as \"black boxes,\" the data recorders should contain information to help determine what caused the crash.    The Yemenia Airways Airbus 310 crashed into the Indian Ocean early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members. It originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and went down just miles from Moroni, the capital of the Comoros Islands.    One person, a 13-year-old French girl, survived.

David Kelly confronted McGuinness in Athlone, Ireland, demanding answers about his father, Patrick Kelly, who he said had been shot dead with a trainee police officer as they attempted to rescue a kidnapped businessman in the Republic of Ireland in 1983.      As shoppers and the media looked on, Kelly demanded that McGuinness name the killers, to which McGuinness replied, \"I don't know who was responsible for the killing of your father.\"      Kelly then accused McGuinness of having been a member of the IRA's ruling Army Council at the time of the killing -- which McGuinness denied. \"You are a liar. I want justice for my father,\" Kelly said.      McGuinness, a former IRA commander and now a leader of the political party Sinn Fein, stepped down from his position as Northern Ireland's deputy first minister to run for president of the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, while the Republic of Ireland is an independent state.      Meanwhile, on Tuesday the widow of murdered Catholic Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane and other family members will hold talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron about their demand for a public inquiry into his 1989 killing. The family says they suspect the British government sanctioned the killing.      Finucane, 39, had represented IRA members in many high-profile cases, but he had also represented pro-British, or loyalist, terrorists. He was gunned down by a loyalist gang at his Belfast home, in front of his wife and three children. His family has long believed the security forces cooperated with the killers. The man convicted of Finucane's murder was a police informer.      John Finucane was the youngest at the family dinner table on the day of the killing, just 8 years old. Now a lawyer himself, he will also attend Tuesday's meeting at Downing Street.      \"The meeting is at the request of the prime minister and we expect to be told what his intentions are,\" he told CNN. \"We are optimistic and hopeful he will announce there is an inquiry and the inquiry is one we can engage with. We are cautiously optimistic, but there have been let-downs over the past 22 years.\"      Finucane says he has \"absolutely no doubt\" the state was involved in his father's murder.      \"That's not just my opinion, that's the opinion of Sir John Stevens, the most senior policeman in England, when he examined it. It's also the opinion of Peter Cory,\" a retired Canadian judge, \"who was tasked with looking at the evidence in the case to decide whether an inquiry was necessary. So it's not just my family that believe there was collusion.      \"I think it's pretty much accepted that there was collusion in my father's killing.\" The question, he said, is \"how high up the chain of command that went.\"      Finucane added that, \"in the absence of a transparent examination of all the relevant evidence, I believe it went as high as the office where I'm going to meet the prime minister.\" The British prime minister at the time was Margaret Thatcher.      While the almost daily violence of the 1970s and 1980s is a thing of the past in Northern Ireland, remnants of \"the troubles\" remain. Some terrorist splinter groups remain active and even have the capacity to kill. Still, the current campaign is on a much smaller scale than in the past.      Sinn Fein, viewed as the IRA's political wing, is now a key player in the peace process and shares power with its former bitter enemies, pro-British lawmakers, in a coalition government in Belfast.      But this week's events show how old wounds still haunt and divide the island. Finucane believes facing the past is the key to continuing progress.      \"The issue of the past is the single most important issue that has the ability to bring both sides of the community here back to a very dark place,\" he said, \"and unresolved cases like my father's do nothing but damage the present society.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a55ee44d208448dc3cbeec9f4485e437349ad2e8.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Are the Gosslins a cautionary tale?", "id": "108062", "answers": [{"text": "Fans can also view the family's situation as a", "answer_start": 4645}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- They say that breaking up is hard to do, especially when millions of eyes are there to witness every caustic comment and verbal volley.    Kate and Jon Gosselin are going through a very public and contentious divorce.    No one knows that better than Jon and Kate Gosselin, whose divorce is playing out on a world stage, complete with tabloid covers, he-said-she-said television appearances and court orders.    Such public spats can do a great deal of harm, said divorce attorney Randall M. Kessler, who's handled several celebrity cases.    \"I just gave a presentation where I said, 'When can press hurt you? It's when clients start talking,'\" Kessler said. \"The hard thing for [famous people] to do is to not speak out, because they are so used to everything they say being quoted and helping them, but this is the opposite. Talking about a divorce is never good.\"    The Gosselins join a growing list of celebrities whose marital woes have been well-documented by the media and paparazzi.  See a gallery of celebrity custody battles \u00bb    Kessler has represented quite a few clients involved in celebrity divorce cases, including Tameka Foster Raymond (who is in the midst of a divorce with superstar singer Usher) and rapper Mack 10 (ex-husband of TLC member Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins), as well as some high-profile paternity and child support lawsuits.    Celebrities often want to protect their reputations and the wrong sound bite can ruin that, Kessler said. Yet, at the same time, it can be difficult for the famous to take direction, he said.    \"They are so used to being in charge of their own destiny and being able to decide what's best for them that it's very hard for them to listen to attorneys, accountants or anyone that is trying to advise them,\" Kessler said.    Viewers have questioned who, if anyone, Jon and Kate Gosselin are taking cues from in their very public marital battle.    In May, Kate defended her husband against rumors that he had been cheating on her and stepping out while she stayed home with their twins and sextuplets.    Weeks later they used their enormously popular TLC reality show, \"Jon & Kate Plus 8\", to admit what fans had begun to suspect: Their marriage was on the rocks.    Soon they announced that they were divorcing, but would continue filming -- albeit separately -- their series, which for four seasons had chronicled the highs and lows of their family life.    It all appeared to be relatively civil until Jon began stepping out with his new girlfriend, moved to a bachelor pad in New York and appeared to be living the high life with shopping sprees and designer duds.    Jon took to the airwaves to reveal that he \"despised Kate.\" Kate lamented that she missed \"the Jon I knew.\"    TLC announced in October that the reality show would continue as \"Kate Plus 8\" and Jon immediately called a halt to filming, claiming the series was doing damage to their children.    Within days, Kate accused Jon of making off with more than $200,000 from their joint bank account. A judge ordered him to return $180,000 to the account.  Watch a discussion about the Gosselin's money madness \u00bb    Through it all, both have maintained they each have the best interests of their children at heart. Child psychologist Joanne Pedro-Carroll said the Gosselins are in a precarious position.    \"It's very concerning, especially given how public this is and the children's young ages, which makes them especially vulnerable,\" Pedro-Carroll said. \"One of the things we know with really young children is that they are prone to misconceptions about the reasons for the breakup.\"    While Jon and Kate haven't so far added a bitter custody dispute to their matrimonial melee, Pedro-Carroll said she worries about the long-term effect on the young Gosselins.    \"Sadly, the things that are happening now, with all of this conflict and having it be so public, puts these children very much at risk for having problems,\" said Pedro-Carroll, author of the forthcoming book \"Putting Children First: Proven Parenting Strategies for Helping Children Thrive After Divorce.\" \"I worry about the children being pulled into loyalty conflicts, thinking about who the good person here is and who's the bad person, when children very much need two loving, responsible parents in their lives.\"    Kessler said he advises his celebrity clients to, when possible, keep the children out of the media and receive training in cooperative parenting.    Lisa Pecot-Hebert, an assistant professor at the College of Communication at DePaul University, said she believes many viewers can relate to the Gosselins' divorce drama.    Fans can also view the family's situation as a cautionary tale, she said.    \"I think viewers can learn that sometimes when people let cameras into their personal lives for our entertainment, oftentimes it ruins what was theirs to begin with,\" Pecot-Hebert said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f42166d0ab9b83d268c87c5d800bf78f656c9a0e.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When did the shooting take place?", "id": "108063", "answers": [{"text": "at Fort Hood Army Post", "answer_start": 104}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Killeen, Texas (CNN) -- The civilian police officer hailed as a heroine for ending the shooting rampage at Fort Hood Army Post said Wednesday she was washing her patrol car just before she headed to the bloody scene.    Sgt. Kimberly Munley was cleaning the car and topping off the gas tank, routine duties at the end of her shift, when she heard the report last Thursday that shots had been fired at the Army post, she told Oprah Winfrey via teleconference.    The brief interview was taped to air later in the day on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\"    Police Senior Sgt. Mark Todd also responded to the scene, where he said they were directed to the Soldier Readiness Processing Center, where soldiers were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq.    Both Munley and Todd didn't know what they were about to face.    \"The entire incident was very confusing and chaotic,\" Munley said. \"There was many people outside pointing to the direction that this individual was apparently located, and as soon as I got out of my vehicle and ran up the hill was when things got pretty bad.\"    Once inside, Munley, who has been trained in active-response tactics, began exchanging fire with the alleged gunman, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a military psychiatrist, authorities said. They said her shots disabled Hasan and halted the attacks.    Thirteen people -- 12 soldiers and one civilian -- were killed.    Munley suffered three gunshot wounds, in both thighs and a knuckle, and remains at Metroplex Adventist Hospital in good condition, authorities said.    \"The training does take over,\" she said when asked about her quick reactions. \"In that particular incident, we didn't have much time to think.\"    \"When I got shot, it felt like a muscle being torn out of my leg,\" she told Winfrey, and added, \"I'm doing well.\"    \"Every day is a progress for me, and things are getting better day by day. And emotionally, I'm just hoping that the rest of the officers and the injured and the families of the deceased are healing as well.\"    Winfrey showed a clip of Metroplex's Dr. Kelly Matlock saying that Munley's first words after the shooting were, \"Did anybody die?\"    The 34-year-old mother of two said she recalled asking that, and she never lost consciousness after being shot.    \"I was very concerned as to who else had been injured,\" Munley said.    Todd was not injured in the rampage. He said he has been a police officer for 25 years and, before that, was in the Army. This was the first time he had been forced to fire his weapon on the job, he said.    He also said last Thursday began as a \"typical day\" for him, with only minor incidents.    At first, when he heard the shots from Fort Hood, he thought the soldiers were practicing the traditional rifle volleys they do at memorial services.    During the incident, Todd said he fired his gun over and over as he'd been trained to do.    Munley, whose husband is in the Army, is 5 feet, 2 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds.    Winfrey asked her where she got her nickname, \"Mighty Mouse.\" Munley said her partner at a police department in North Carolina called her that after she was able to help when he was being wrestled for his weapon. The nickname stuck.    Todd said he was grateful that he was able to return safely home to his family at the end of that day.    \"I just thank God he missed me,\" he said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/ed1df9b7c58f0da7d3d7cb2d585481a516b8a998.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did sheriff's department say?", "id": "108069", "answers": [{"text": "does not intend to open an investigation", "answer_start": 891}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, accused of sexually assaulting a woman last summer, said Thursday that he is innocent.    Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger says there is no merit to the accusation.    \"Saturday was the first that I learned of her accusations,\" the Pittsburgh Steeler said, calling the accusation reckless, false and an attack on his family.    The woman filed a civil complaint against Roethlisberger last week.    \"I would never, ever force myself on a woman,\" he said.    The complaint, filed Friday in the 2nd Judicial District Court in Washoe County, Nevada, alleges that Roethlisberger sexually assaulted the woman -- an executive casino host at Harrah's Lake Tahoe -- while he was staying at the resort for a celebrity golf tournament in July 2008.    Teresa Duffy of the Douglas County, Nevada, Sheriff's Department, said the department does not intend to open an investigation unless the alleged victim comes forward and tells authorities she wants them to.    Roethlisberger said that he would not discuss the \"civil case in the media,\" but that he would fight to protect his family and his reputation.    Roethlisberger and eight Harrah's employees are named in the suit, which seeks at least $390,000, plus unspecified punitive damages, from the defendants.    Harrah's itself is not named as a defendant.    The woman said that the employees contributed to her emotional distress and that some defamed her and tried to cover up the incident.    According to the complaint, on July 11, 2008, the woman was working on the 17th floor -- the same floor as Roethlisberger's room -- when Roethlisberger told her that his television and sound system were not working.    He asked her to try to fix it, the complaint said. When she entered his room and deemed that the television was working, she tried to leave, but Roethlisberger blocked her way, the complaint states.    He then, against her will, kissed her, groped her and sexually assaulted her, the complaint states.    The woman says that in the months following the incident, she incurred emotional distress that resulted in hospitalizations that included treatment for anxiety and depression, the complaint said.    Calvin Dunlap, the woman's attorney, said earlier this week that his client did not pursue criminal charges after the alleged assault because she felt discouraged when the resort's chief of security did not investigate the matter. According to the complaint, the chief told her she was \"overreacting.\"    Dunlap said the chief has \"close ties to law enforcement.\"    Of the eight employees, all but two are still employed by Harrah's, according to a spokeswoman for Harrah's Entertainment.    Marybel Batjer of Harrah's declined to comment on the suit, other than to say that the alleged victim still works at Harrah's Lake Tahoe as an executive casino host.    Another Harrah's Entertainment spokesman, Gary Thompson, said the company was \"confident that a much different story will emerge and that the Harrah's employees will be dismissed from the lawsuit.\"    Roethlisberger's attorney, David Cornwell, released a statement saying the charges were false.    \"The timing of a lawsuit and the absence of a criminal complaint and a criminal investigation are the most compelling evidence of the absence of any criminal conduct,\" he said.

Banksy's latest piece in East London where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist.  The guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils around Britain and further afield for over ten years. Last week ten of his original pieces were sold at Bonham's auction house in London for over $1 million, while on the other side of the city Tower Hamlets council authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets.  From his beginnings as a graffiti artist in Bristol, England, Banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art. Depicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats, his work is now sold now by major art galleries.  Lazarides Gallery in London is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as \"a media star...but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff.\"  While he set out to lampoon the establishment, he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it. Fans include Hollywood A-listers, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera who bought three of his prints in 2006, including one of Queen Victoria sitting on a woman's face. The recent sales of his work put him on a par with Jean-Michel Basquiat as the best-selling street artist.  He is feted by art dealers and artists, including Damien Hirst, but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stunts such as hanging his own work in the Tate gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It took the British Museum eight days to discover the \"prehistoric\" rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in the British Museum Banksy has hung on a wall.  There is often a political message with this work, too. He left an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo prisoner in Disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the Palestinian side of the West Bank wall.  Despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work, Banksy's identity remains a mystery. As he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense, but also adds to his mystique. Some things are know: he's originally from Bristol, is around 30 years old and called Robert or Robin Banks, but it's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator.  He continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art. Veteran British art critic Brian Sewell called Banksy, \"a complete clown, and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art.\"  Bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city. Other local authorities don't feel the same way. Tower Hamlets and Hackney councils in London have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets.  His latest work painted on a wall in East London -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist's response.  But this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like. A passer-by took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work. A spokesperson for Banksy refused to confirm it was him, but did say it was definitely his work.

Surrounded by soldiers and about 100 journalists who came to witness the end of an era in Haiti, the dictator boarded a United States Air Force C-141 jet along with his glamorous wife, Michele Bennet, their two children and 20 friends and servants.      Also on the plane that day were trunks of designer clothes, gold, jewels and priceless art. What could not be seen was the hundreds of millions of dollars Haitian officials accused the Duvalier clan of stealing from state coffers.      The pillaging of Haiti's national treasury now lies at the heart of legal action against Duvalier, who stunned the world by returning to Haiti this week from some 25 years of quiet exile in France.      Some lawyers who have been following the Duvalier money trail for years were flabbergasted that such a man was able to enter Haiti legally, that he was not arrested right away.      \"I don't know how a criminal like him goes free,\" said Enrico Monfrini, a Switzerland-based lawyer who has been representing the Haitian government in a long and drawn out legal battle over Duvalier's cash.      Duvalier reportedly lost a chunk of his wealth when he and Bennet divorced, but the family still has $5.7 million in assets in a frozen bank account in Switzerland that belongs to a family foundation.      Now, a Swiss law enacted specifically to help repatriate stolen funds from failing states may help return the Duvalier money to Haiti, said Daniel Thelesklaf, executive director of the International Centre for Asset Recovery in Switzerland.      \"I am optimistic there will be a decision by the end of the year,\" he said.      The law, which goes into effect February 1, was enacted to help Switzerland overcome existing hurdles with states that have no mutual legal assistance partnership with Switzerland or with troubled nations that are incapable of dealing with such issues, according to the Swiss Foreign Ministry.      For a judge order restitution, a government must prove a discrepancy between the wealth of a \"politically exposed person\" and his or her earnings, along with high levels of corruption in that country.      \"They managed to draft this law very quickly,\" Monfrini said, adding that legal proceedings in Haiti would not affect efforts at restitution.      He said $5.7 million is not a large amount compared to what Duvalier allegedly stole, but morally, repatriation of the money would be a huge victory.      But not a complete one until Duvalier is made to stand trial for his alleged crimes, said human rights lawyer Mario Joseph, who has worked in Haiti on building the legal case against Duvalier.      Joseph said no one in Haiti ever imagined that Duvalier would return to face charges. His presence in the country has enabled the court to reopen a 2008 case against the strongman, he said.      But Duvalier's lawyer, Reynold Georges, expressed confidence Wednesday that Haitian authorities have little evidence to press charges. Duvalier, said Georges, would not only remain a free man but he could decide to return to politics.      Georges later told CNN that Duvalier had given \"all that money\" to charity for Haitian relief after the earthquake.      \"I don't know if the Swiss bank transferred that money already, so I don't have any details on that,\" Georges said, \"but I guarantee you that that has been done.\"      Dismayed by the thought of the return of a brutal dictator, Monfrini pressed upon Haiti's justice system to prevail, and for the courts not to forget what Duvalier pledged in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake.

She is the author of \"On the Courthouse Lawn: Confronting the Legacy of Lynching in the 21st Century,\" and is a regular contributor to The Root at http://www.theroot.com/.    Sherrilyn Ifill says Sonia Sotomayor's speech was an honest effort to describe how judges rule on cases.    (CNN) -- When Don Imus denigrated in clearly racist terms the championship women's basketball team from Rutgers University; when actor Michael Richards screamed at black guests in a comedy club, calling them the \"n-word\" and invoking the threat of lynching; when Trent Lott said that things would have been better if a southern segregationist had been elected president a half-century earlier, responsible white people from across the ideological spectrum stepped forward to explain that these individuals were not racist.    The \"R\" word has become the taboo of the white world. By this I mean that calling someone racist is a taboo, not racism itself.    So when Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich and several other conservative commentators call a sitting federal appeals court judge and Supreme Court nominee who happens to be Latina, a racist, it's time to push back. Real hard.    The evidence offered in support of Judge Sonia Sotomayor's alleged racism is a speech she gave in Berkeley, California, in honor of Judge Mario G. Olmos, a former judge, community leader and graduate of Boalt Hall Law School who died an untimely death at the age of 43.    The offending section of the speech is this: \"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\" This passage inspired Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives and potential 2012 presidential candidate, to call Judge Sotomayor \"a Latina racist.\"    To lift one statement out of Judge Sotomayor's eight-page speech without examining the context and substance of her remarks, is an example of the kind of shoddy character assassination that I suspect will dominate this judicial confirmation process.    Judge Sotomayor's speech is, in fact, an excellent meditation on how the experiences of judges might affect how they approach aspects of judicial decision-making. It explores the important, and too-little examined reality that judicial deliberations can be affected by a judge's background, perspective and experience.    In the next sentence immediately following the passage above, Judge Sotomayor says, \"Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice [Benjamin] Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society.\"    Could she have been referring to Buck v. Bell, the 1927 case in which Justice Holmes -- widely regarded as perhaps the most brilliant justice in the Supreme Court's history -- upheld the state's plan to sterilize Carrie Buck, an 18-year-old white woman, who was accused of being congenitally retarded. Buck's main crime seems to have been the fact that she'd had a child out of wedlock.    In any case, Justice Holmes upheld the sterilization order, emphatically and coldly stating, \"three generations of imbeciles is enough.\" Does anyone seriously believe that a woman, and especially a woman of color \"with the richness of her experiences\" would not have \"reach[ed] a better conclusion \" than that adopted by Justice Holmes in 1927?    In fact Buck v. Bell is the perfect example of how a \"wise old [white] man\" got it wrong in a way that a woman judge or a racial minority most likely would not.    It's worth pointing out that in that same speech Judge Sotomayor cautioned, \"we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group.\" But she acknowledges that \"there may be some [difference in her judging] based on my gender and my Latina heritage.\"    What Gingrich and others decry in Judge Sotomayor should be applauded. Judge Sotomayor has the humility to recognize the difficulty of achieving true and pure impartiality. Instead, as she pointed out in her speech, \"[t]he aspiration to impartiality is just that -- it's an aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others.\"    Unlike so many judges who by virtue of being white and male simply assume their impartiality, Judge Sotomayor recognizes that all judges are affected by their background and their life experiences.    Ironically, it was Justice Cardozo who recognized this when he said, \"[t]he great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men, do not turn aside in their course, and pass the judge by.\" Justice Cardozo concluded that \"[n]o effort or revolution of the mind will overthrow utterly and at all times the empire of ... [a judge's] subconscious loyalties.    These are the realities of judicial decision-making evoked by Judge Sotomayor's speech. It's perhaps easier to say as [then-Supreme Court nominee] Clarence Thomas so famously did, that a judge can simply, \"strip down like a runner,\" and become utterly impartial simply by putting on a black robe. But it is more honest to acknowledge that regardless of race, gender, ideology or professional background, impartiality is always a work-in-progress for judges.    Even Judge Richard Posner, a conservative stalwart on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals once observed that, \"Litigation commonly involves persons at different social distances form the judge, and the more proximate will garner the more sympathetic response regardless of actual desert.\"    Justice Thomas is the perfect example of how hard it can be for a judge to lay aside the personal experiences that shape his worldview. His views about the affirmative action cases that come before him are shaped quite clearly by what he regards as the self-sufficient dignity of his hard-working grandfather and the humiliation he says he felt when others believed his scholarly accomplishments were the result of affirmative action.    White judges are also shaped by their background and experiences. They needn't ever speak of it, simply because their whiteness and gender insulates them from the presumption of partiality and bias that is regularly attached to women judges and judges of color when it comes to matters of race and gender.    Only a judge who is conscious and fully engaged with the reality of how her experiences may bear on her approach to the facts of a case, or sense of social justice, or vision of constitutional interpretation, should be entrusted to sit on the most influential and powerful court in our nation.    Too often we have allowed ourselves to be placated and charmed by fantasies about umpire judges calling \"balls and strikes,\" without ever asking which league the game is being played in or whether the umpire was standing in the best position to see the play. We forget that when deciding whether a batter checked his swing, the homeplate umpire will routinely ask for the alternative perspective from the first or third base umpire before calling a \"swing and a miss\" a strike.    Judge Sotomayor rightly suggests that these things matter. She notes in her speech that \"personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see.\" She should know this. She's been a trial judge. None of the other justices who will serve with Judge Sotomayor will have had that experience.    Judge Sotomayor's speech is one of the most honest and compelling statements about judicial impartiality we're likely to hear from a judge of her stature.    It ends with this humble observation:    \"Each day on the bench I learn something new about the judicial process and about being a professional Latina woman in a world that sometimes looks at me with suspicion. I am reminded each day that I render decisions that affect people concretely and that I owe them constant and complete vigilance in checking my assumptions, presumptions and perspectives and ensuring that to the extent that my limited abilities and capabilities permit me, that I re-evaluate them and change as circumstances and cases before me requires. I can and do aspire to be greater than the sum total of my experiences, but I accept my limitations. I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting from experience and heritage but attempt, as the Supreme Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies and prejudices are appropriate.\"    It's entirely appropriate to question Judge Sotomayor about this speech at her confirmation hearings. She is evidently more than capable of explaining in compelling, clear language what precisely she wanted to convey in this speech. But Judge Sotomayor is not a racist.    It is an insult of unimaginable proportion to unleash this charge on her, based on one sentence from her Berkeley, California, speech. It is not just irresponsible to make this charge against a sitting federal appeals court judge based on this flimsy record; it is -- and here I'll break the taboo -- racist to do so.

Treasure hunters use modern technology to try to locate the lost Nazi gold.    Heinz Peter Haustein, one of the two treasure hunters and a member of Germany's parliament, said: \"We have already hit a hollow area under the surface, it's filled with water and we are not sure if it is the cave we are looking for.\"    Digging was stopped more than a week ago amid safety concerns, as authorities and the treasure hunters feared that the shaft might collapse and that the cave -- if it is there -- may be rigged with explosives or poisonous booby traps.    At a news conference Friday, Christian Hanisch, the other treasure hunter, said that geological surveying equipment had located a possible cave about 30 feet under the surface containing \"precious metals that can only be either gold or silver. The instruments would not have reacted to any other metal like copper.\"  See photos from hunt for lost Nazi gold \u00bb    Hanisch pointed out that his father, who was a navigator in the Luftwaffe, the Nazi air force, was one of the troops said to have been involved in hiding art, gold and silver as the Nazis realized that they would lose the war.    He said that when his father died, he left coordinates leading to the spot in Deutschneudorf.    \"It's not about getting the reward,\" Hanisch said at the site. \"I just want to know if my father was right and if my instincts were right.\"    Haustein, who is paying for the expedition, said he hopes that finding the gold could lead to the Amber Room, whose interior is made completely of amber and gold. It was looted by the Nazis from a castle in St. Petersburg, Russia, after Adolf Hitler's forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.    The room looked so majestic, many called it \"the eighth wonder of the world.\" It disappeared after the war, and today a replica stands in its place in St. Petersburg.    Although parts of the Amber Room have resurfaced, the vast majority remains missing.    Haustein has been looking for the room for more than 12 years.  Watch hunt for Nazi gold at German mountain \u00bb    \"I am certain that large parts of the Amber Room are buried somewhere here,\" he said.    He said he has collected much circumstantial evidence suggesting that the Nazis hid the Amber Room in old copper mines around Deutschneudorf, but he has no proof.    Haustein said the Nazis began bringing valuables including art, gold and silver to the region around Deutschneudorf as early as summer 1944.    Deutschneudorf is in Germany's Ore Mountains, and the mountain where the treasure hunters claim to have found the Nazi gold was a copper mine until the 19th century. Although the mine was shut down in 1882, geologists found evidence that soldiers from Hitler's Wehrmacht -- the German armed forces -- had been there. The machine guns, parts of uniforms and explosives are on display at the town's museum.    Though both treasure hunters say they are certain they will find cultural goods, both admit that they fear disappointment.    \"Of course, if you embark on something like this, you ask yourself: 'What if we find nothing again? What if I was fooled?' \" Haustein said. \"But every man has to go his own way, for better or for worse.\"    If they do find the treasure, Haustein says, it would legally belong to Germany, although he would recommend that Germany give any Amber Room parts back to Russia.    Treasure hunters have typically received rewards of 10 percent of the value of the goods found, but Hanisch says there are no laws dictating the reward amount.

Annie Lennox's new album, a best-of, will be her last with Sony.  They're a translucent blue-green, both kind and inviting in one glance, then piercing and all-knowing in another. At 54, Lennox's orbs are as captivating today as they were when they stared at us from under that fiery orange crew cut in the music video for the Eurythmics hit \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).\"  That was 1983. Yes, Lennox's Eurythmics days seem like a lifetime ago for the Scotland-born singer-songwriter, especially when you consider the successful solo career she's enjoyed since her partnership with Dave Stewart.  It's that body of work -- songs like 'Why\" and \"No More 'I Love You's' \" that are showcased on her newest album, \"The Annie Lennox Collection.\" It's Lennox's fifth solo outing, and her final album with her record label of 30 years, Sony Music Entertainment.  \"It's like a demarcation line in a way because there is that body of work to look back on in retrospect,\" says Lennox. \"And the future is ahead of me and that's very interesting because I'm really not sure exactly what that's going to mean logistically ... how that's going to pan out. But I'm very excited about it because of Internet technology.\"  Watch Lennox talk about catharsis \u00bb  Lennox, who's won Grammys, BRIT Awards and an Academy Award (for co-writing \"Into the West\" from \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\"), says she's become somewhat of a voracious blogger, using her MySpace page and official Web site not only as a repository for her musical work, but also to lend a voice to her humanitarian efforts. In 2007, Lennox formed the SING Campaign, a nonprofit initiative to help fight the HIV pandemic in Africa.  The initiative has its own anthem, called \"SING,\" which features vocals from Madonna and Celine Dion among others, and is included on Lennox's new album. She also recorded two new tracks to celebrate the release, one a cover of Irish band Ash's hit song \"Shining Light.\"  \"It's one of those incredible anthemic songs that just stay with you,\" she says. \"It's like when you heard Jeff Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah.' It's almost like a revelation when you hear it.\"  Lennox spoke to CNN about tapping into her inner divas to make those theatrical music videos, the pitfalls of fame and why she celebrates her naivet\u00e9.  CNN: Who is your \"shining light\"?  Annie Lennox: Ordinary people who don't necessarily have the spotlight shone on them, who do extraordinary things. Those people always inspire me. A lot of people that are working in nongovernmental organizations inspire me very much, because I think those people are really risking life and limb to make a difference to people's lives in really impossible circumstances. And they really give me the sense that if they can do that, I can do something, too.  CNN: How do you feel about where you are in life right now?  Lennox: Of course now I'm in that middle-age place, age-wise, and youth is no longer really something that I'm a part of anymore. And that started happening for me when I was about 40, to be honest with you. I had my kids and my focus went elsewhere. And I think I've changed so much through having children ... inside myself. It's been a kind of evolution and a maturity.  And that has informed the SING Campaign a lot, because my focus is really on women. ... I understand what it is for a woman to want to protect their children and give them the best they can. And so I identify with that. ... I can let go of some of the things I was maybe focused on when I was younger and I'm focused on different things.  CNN: Over the years your music videos have served as an outlet to explore different personas. Is that a cathartic experience for you?  Lennox: Performance feels quite cathartic, to be honest with you. It's a good feeling. And songwriting is cathartic because you have something you want to express. ... Ultimately when you've completed that songwriting process there is a sense of yes ... completion. It's out. It's expressed. It's done. And then you can communicate it to other people in performance.  CNN: You come across as extremely fearless in your videos. Yet you've said as a person you're quite shy. You don't seem shy to me.  Lennox: No I'm not shy right now, but I can be quite shy. It depends on the circumstances. ... Shyness is actually quite crippling. When one is shy it's not helpful. But a lot of being on stage has given me that opportunity to go beyond my normal persona.  CNN: Which music video are you most proud of?  Lennox: Quite a few. I think that \"Broken Glass\" is just ... it's hilarious. A lot of the things I do have got humor in them. But the fact that we had John Malkovich who came in and Hugh Laurie who was there ... we had a big cast.  CNN: A lot of your songs are about pain and failed relationships. Do you still feel that you have a lot to learn about love?  Lennox: I think we all do. I think the world needs to be a far more loving place. And I think we are confused between erotic love [and] unconditional love. I think our sexuality is a very different thing from our love. ... We are a society fixated with sexuality and it can be very cruel. When the love, and the respect and the consideration [are] missing, people live very isolated existences.  CNN: What has fame taught you?  Lennox: I think fame for fame's sake is a very toxic thing. ... And people in this society have this idea that they wanna be famous, and they don't know what for. And they pursue \"celebrity\" for itself.  I would say that without something to offer, whether it be that you're an actor, you have a craft, you have something to offer people, if you're a writer, a painter, a musician ... when it's just about you and your actual life it's a little bit cannibalistic.  The industry of celebrity is quite a savage one and when you fall foul of it, and your privacy is so brutally invaded ... you may be having difficulties in your own life as we all do ... and all the images of you, your dogs, your children, the inside of your house ... they're all splattered across every front page, I think that's [a] very unhealthy place to be. And I think it's sad that people caught it so vociferously.  CNN: Well you obviously raised two children. How difficult was it to shield them from your fame?  Lennox: It hasn't been too difficult. Part of my work is public, but I make a distinction between that and who I am as a person in private. ... I was very careful that ... I wasn't telling stories to gossip papers, and showing my life and [my children] were gently kept away from that.  CNN: Fame also serves as a useful platform, and you've been very involved with various charities, notably HIV/AIDS. Do you ever feel frustrated that you you're not making as big a difference as you would like?  Lennox: I had to think about this very carefully because I understand that there are so many problems in the world. Infinitely. And there always will be. That will never change, no. ... And if you make this decision to get involved, don't think that there's just an end result and that's what you're aiming for. No, it's the day-to-day commitment. It's the small steps that really count, in my opinion.  CNN: I've read that you consider yourself to be quite naive. Is that still true?  Lennox: I still have an aspect of naivet\u00e9, and I think it's a valuable thing, because if I was jaded and cynical 100 percent as I could be, you know I would be less human and I think my acknowledgment that I can be naive is fine.

Putin said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Russia in the early hours of Friday on long-range missions.  \"We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis,\" Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia's Ural mountains.  \"Today, August 17 at 00:00 hours, 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country, along with support and refueling aircraft ...

Putin caused a stir this year by saying Russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in Europe if Washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe.  Russian diplomats have clashed with the United States and European governments on issues such as Kosovo, energy, and Moscow's treatment of its ex-Soviet neighbors.  Western military leaders have said this year that Russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period.  One Western defense official called the flights \"a little bit of chest-pounding, trying to let people know Russia is back in the game\".  Putin said that when Russia had cut its flights in 1992, other military powers had not reciprocated.  \"Flights by other countries' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation,\" Putin said.  That appeared to be a swipe at the U.S. and NATO, whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions.  As Putin spoke to reporters and television cameras, four Russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while Russian tanks trundled behind him, even though the exercises had ended long before.  During the Cold War, Russian long-range bombers, which can carry strategic nuclear weapons, played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with Western air forces.  Earlier this month Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Guam, where the U.S. military has a base, and \"exchanged smiles\" with U.S. pilots scrambled to track them.  The Pentagon said the Russian aircraft had not come close enough to U.S. ships to prompt American aircraft to react.  In July, two Russian Tu-95 \"Bear\" bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea, leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them. Russia's air force said later it was a routine flight.

The company said it is recalling an estimated 300,000 cases of the dough as a precaution after reports of food-borne illness in 28 states.    There are concerns that the premade dough may be contaminated with the bacterium E. coli 0157:H7, which causes abdominal cramping, vomiting and diarrhea, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Young children and the elderly can suffer more serious symptoms.    Nestle issued a statement saying, \"While the E. coli strain implicated in this investigation has not been detected in our product, the health and safety of our consumers is paramount, so we are initiating this voluntary recall.\"    According to Nestle spokeswoman Laurie MacDonald, raw dough was one of the things the sick people reported eating.    \"The health and safety of our consumers is our No. 1 priority,\" she said. \"We felt the best thing to do is a voluntary recall.\"    She said the company was informed by the FDA Wednesday night \"and immediately took action.\"    \"We really want to remind consumers that raw cookie dough should not be eaten,\" she said.

O'Berry said the tugboat Rotterdam arrived shortly before 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET).    Repairs will be made aboard the Antalina, which has a broken fuel pump, while at sea, O'Berry said.    The tugboat will then tow the ship to Port Arthur, Texas, where it will undergo additional repairs and eventually offload more of its cargo -- petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct -- O'Berry said.    The crew members aboard the Antalina, a Cypriot-flagged freighter, are all in good health, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Ron Labrec.    The freighter suffered no major damage from the storm, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesman for the company that manages the ship.    Aircraft from the Coast Guard and Air Force were sent Friday afternoon to try to rescue the crew of the freighter, which is loaded with petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct.    But high winds forced the military to abort the rescue, O'Berry said.    The Coast Guard then instructed the freighter to contact it each hour. It also told told the crew to turn on the ship's emergency radio beacon so its position could be monitored, O'Berry said.  Watch the Coast Guard conduct a rescue operation \u00bb    Onshore as well, rescuers found it too dangerous to respond to calls for help.    In Liverpool, Texas, south of Houston, a family called for help around 1 a.m. Saturday when a tree crashed into their house, but authorities concluded that strong winds made it too dangerous to respond, said Doc Adams, Brazoria County's emergency management coordinator.    \"You want to take care of people, and when you can't, it's tough,\" Adams said.    \"Unfortunately, someone has to make the decision about whether the risk is worth the benefit. Are you willing to risk three or four lives to save one? It's not easy.\"    Adams said he didn't know if anyone in the house was hurt.    \"As far as I know, they're still there in the house with a tree over it,\" he said at about 3:40 a.m.    The stranded freighter had been headed south through the Gulf of Mexico from Port Arthur, Texas, but \"lost main propulsion 90 miles southeast of Galveston\" and was unable to steer, the Coast Guard said.    The Coast Guard received a distress call from the vessel at 4 a.m. Friday. The Antalina was \"basically adrift, at the mercy of the wind and sea currents,\" Coast Guard Petty Officer Tom Atkeson said at the time.    \"We are in hell,\" one of the men aboard the freighter told CNN on Friday before the rescue was called off. The man said the winds around the ship were strong but that the freighter still had power.    On Friday before the storm hit, authorities picked up more than 120 people stranded by rising seas along the southeast Texas coast.    Most of the rescues occurred in Galveston County, where rising water and other effects of the storm began hours before landfall early Saturday.    Stranded residents were airlifted from Crystal Beach, Bolivar Peninsula and other communities in the Galveston area. Many of those rescued were motorists stranded on flooded roads.    In Surfside Beach, police waded through chest-high rushing water to rescue five people trapped in their homes. One man refused to leave, said Surfside Beach police Chief Randy Smith.    \"Some of them took convincing, some of them didn't,\" Smith said.    Police also rescued five other people who waded out to meet the officers.    About half of those rescues were done by helicopters out of bases along the coast, said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Schulein.    Three HH-65C helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Houston rescued more than 20 people and continued to fly rescue missions until weather grounded them Friday evening, said Petty Officer Renee Aiello, a station spokeswoman.    Some 37,000 people may need to be rescued in the aftermath of the hurricane, a U.S. military official estimated Friday. Texas already has asked for help, and the active-duty military has 42 search-and-rescue helicopters on standby, the official said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/95841efd77f244db5fce3bd2a5e43e5b825923ca.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who did he struggle with in the relationship?", "id": "108103", "answers": [{"text": "his lover.\"", "answer_start": 1184}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- An internationally known Catholic priest who was shown in photographs last week embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman on a Florida beach has admitted they had a two-year affair.    The Rev. Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman.    The Rev. Alberto Cutie -- sometimes called \"Father Oprah\" because of the advice he gave on Spanish-language media -- said Monday on CBS' \"Early Show\" that he is in love with the woman and is considering his options: Whether to break up with her or leave the priesthood and marry her. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, wants to get married, Cutie said.    The priest was removed from his duties last week at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach, Florida, and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks.    \"I take full responsibility for what I did, and I know it's wrong,\" he said Monday.    The photos of the Cuban-American priest, also known as \"Padre Alberto,\" appeared on the cover of last week's TV Notas magazine and on eight inside pages. The cover says in Spanish: \"Good God! Padre Alberto. First photos of a priest 'in flagrante' with his lover.\"    Other media outlets throughout Latin America, including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico, picked up the story, and it became an Internet sensation. Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world.    In a message posted on the Miami, Florida, archdiocese Web page last week, Archbishop John C. Favalora apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a \"scandal.\"    \"Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God,\" Favalora said. \"Father Cutie's actions cannot be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest.\"    Cutie expressed his regret in an online statement last week and again Monday on the CBS program.    \"I deeply apologize to the Catholic community and especially to my bishop and to my brother priests who are faithful and who are committed to celibacy,\" Cutie said.    The priest said he believes in celibacy but thinks it should be optional. He said he had never had a sexual relationship with anyone other than the woman since leaving the seminary 15 years ago.  Watch Father Cutie question the celibacy requirement \u00bb    \"I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise,\" Cutie said. \"I understand fully that this is wrong.    \"I don't want to be the anti-celibacy priest. I think that's unfortunate,\" he said. \"I think it's a debate that's going on in our society, and now I've become kind of a poster boy for it. But I don't want to be that. I believe that celibacy is good, and that it's a good commitment to God. This is something I've struggled with. And something that I never expected to become a public debate.\"    He also talked about the woman, saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on, but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago. They have \"both struggled\" with the relationship, he said.    \"She's also a woman of faith,\" Cutie said. \"She's also somebody who cares about the priesthood, who cares about these things. So it hasn't been easy. And those who have helped me through this process know it hasn't been easy. Obviously, you know, through the photos, it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that.\"    Cutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network, his information on the LinkedIn online professional network says.

He made me want to be a better person.\"      Two days after the wedding, Davis moved to Alaska to be with her husband, Michael Davis, who was stationed at an Army base there, putting their honeymoon plans on hold.      \"He wanted to take me to Hawaii,\" she remembered. But they never got to take that trip.      On May 21, 2007, Davis came home to find two men waiting to tell her that her husband had been killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq.      At 21, Davis was a widow.      Consumed by grief, she felt she had nowhere to turn for support. After her husband was deployed to Iraq, Davis moved back home to San Marcos, Texas, away from a military community.      \"I didn't live near any bases,\" she said. \"When Michael was killed, I was in my senior year in college. I didn't have a connection to military wives.\"      But Davis was not alone.      Since 2001, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have left 2,829 women without husbands and 46 men without wives, according to a May 2011 report from the Defense Manpower Data Center.      \"In the beginning after I lost Michael, I honestly wanted to die,\" she said. \"I wanted someone 21 to say, 'I got the knock on the door. I had the two men who said the words that shattered my world. And I am like you and trying to pick up the pieces.' \"      So she made it her mission to seek out other widows. She contacted a widow whose husband was killed alongside hers.      \"I gave her a call one day, and I said, 'I want to know all the things that people stopped asking me. I want to know how you met your husband. I want to know how you fell in love, how you were notified, and most importantly, I want to know what makes you get up every day and face life again,' because I didn't know the answers.\"      Davis found other widows on MySpace and used some of the $100,000 she received in military death benefits to buy video equipment.      Then she set out across the country to interview six widows in six different cities.      \"It was in the midst of filming that documentary that I got the idea of starting a nonprofit organization that would allow these women to have a place to share all the things that we basically were asking [in the film],\" she said.      Four months after Davis' husband was killed, the American Widow Project was born. Since then, more than 750 widows have joined the organization.      It started with the website -- a place for young widows to share their stories, learn from one another and find comfort in knowing they're not alone.      Then Davis began organizing \"getaway\" trips so the widows could meet in person.      The trips have ranged from skydiving out of planes to rebuilding a house damaged by Hurricane Katrina through the St. Bernard Project.      Brooke Toner, a widow who helped rebuild the house in New Orleans, said it was hard to find other people who understood what she was going through.      \"After Frankie died, I just felt like there was nothing that was going to give me any comfort,\" Toner said. \"I felt like nobody could understand that amount of loss of my best friend, my husband, my soul mate.      \"I didn't even think that these women could understand that. But I've been fortunate to meet all of them. They're dealing with so much of it, and they're on a similar path. For me, it's comforting.\"      Erin Dructor, who also lost her husband, agrees.      \"It's opened my eyes to show me different ways on how to be able to handle things to where I feel like I'm not alone,\" she said. \"It's definitely helped me heal more.\"      For Davis, starting the organization has helped her just as much as it's helping other young widows.      \"In the beginning, it was hard for me to even laugh or smile because I thought if people saw me laughing or smiling, they would think that I was over Michael,\" she said. \"In reality, I've learned that when I'm laughing and smiling and I feel most alive is when I feel my husband the most.      \"We're all on different journeys. We all have different paths. But to come here on one of our getaways for at least three days and just feel united, feel the love of our husbands and feel the love of our new lives that we're rebuilding together ... that's the thing that gets me through it.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/cb5ddd17aa8ae97c85981b48b316ac8a1f41394a.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who spoke to the gunman before the rampage?", "id": "108108", "answers": [{"text": "Jean-Francois Dister,", "answer_start": 374}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- A man who killed five people and himself in a gun and grenade attack in Belgium feared going back to prison and losing the life he had built, his lawyer said Thursday.      The attack on a crowded market square in Liege Tuesday by Nourdine Amrani, which also left at least 130 people wounded, shocked the nation.      His defense lawyer in Liege, Jean-Francois Dister, told CNN Amrani had called him late Monday and early Tuesday after the police called him in for interview Tuesday afternoon over a sexual assault case.      \"It wasn't so much life in prison that bothered him -- he'd served time already -- but it was he'd rebuilt his life on the outside, and he was worried about losing all this,\" Dister said.      The lawyer said he was stunned when he heard later that day that Amrani, whom he had known for two-and-a-half years, was responsible for the grenade attack.      \"It's very shocking. I don't understand the reason why he did this, and I think I will probably never understand,\" he said.      Nonetheless, Dister's comments give the first real insight into what might have motivated Amrani to go on a rampage that targeted people waiting at a bus stop by a busy Christmas market.      After the attack, police also found a dead woman in a residence next to a workshop where Amrani once grew marijuana, a local police spokesman said Wednesday.      Amrani had previously served time in prison for rape and drug trafficking offenses, his lawyer said. He was released last year.      Dister said Amrani was also convicted on weapons charges in 2008 but later acquitted. Liege authorities have not said he was cleared on those counts.      Liege prosecutor Danielle Reynders told CNN Wednesday that the police interview involved a sexual assault case, rather than a rumored rape allegation.      \"Because Amrani was convicted of rape in 2003, police obviously regarded him as a person of interest,\" Dister said.      Dister said his client, who had a Belgian partner whom Dister had met several times, feared losing everything.      \"He was someone that was integrated into society. He felt Belgian. I'm not sure if he was a practicing Muslim but he knew about his culture and his roots,\" Dister said.      \"When things were going well for him he was very pleasant and good-natured. I never had problems with him. But, that said, sometimes when legal proceedings were dragging on, or he was accused of things he claimed (he) was not responsible for he could become annoyed and agitated -- but it was in words only.\"      Dister said Amrani did not to his knowledge take drugs and had not been charged with drugs use.      Authorities will conduct an autopsy in part to see whether Amrani was under the influence of drugs during the attack, said a senior Belgian security source who has been briefed on the investigation but did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.      It is not yet clear how Amrani, who Reynders said was a Brussels-born Belgian citizen of Moroccan descent, obtained the pistol, semi-automatic rifle and three grenades he used in the attack.      Katrin Delcourt, a spokeswoman for the provincial governor's office, described Amrani Wednesday as having significant gunsmith and firearms skills.      For a period up to 2008, he held a French hunting license under which he bought at least one weapon, she said, but that license was revoked as a result of the police investigation that led to his conviction on arms and drugs trafficking offenses in 2008.      The weapons he owned then were destroyed and police are continuing to investigate whether the arms used in Tuesday's attack were bought on the black market, Delcourt said.      One of the weapons he had, a light automatic rifle, is a standard weapon in the Belgian army, she said.      Amrani left no explanation for his actions, investigators have said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a0dff972172125f32b79977a47b0d250be8f71e4.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What type of care is currently offered?", "id": "108112", "answers": [{"text": "an 800 number to call for help.", "answer_start": 1576}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Every day, five U.S. soldiers try to kill themselves. Before the Iraq war began, that figure was less than one suicide attempt a day.    A U.S. soldier patrols the streets of Baghdad in January.    The dramatic increase is revealed in new U.S. Army figures, which show 2,100 soldiers tried to commit suicide in 2007.    \"Suicide attempts are rising and have risen over the last five years,\" said Col. Elspeth Cameron-Ritchie, an Army psychiatrist.    Concern over the rate of suicide attempts prompted Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, to introduce legislation Thursday to improve the military's suicide-prevention programs.    \"Our troops and their families are under unprecedented levels of stress due to the pace and frequency of more than five years of deployments,\" Webb said in a written statement.  Watch CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent Jamie McIntyre on the reasons for the increase in suicides \u00bb    Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, took to the Senate floor Thursday, urging more help for military members, especially for those returning from war.    \"Our brave service members who face deployment after deployment without the rest, recovery and treatment they need are at the breaking point,\" Murray said.    She said Congress has given \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to the military to improve its ability to provide mental health treatment, but said it will take more than money to resolve the problem.    \"It takes leadership and it takes a change in the culture of war,\" she said. She said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help.    \"Many soldiers need a real person to talk to,\" she said. \"And they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists.\"    According to Army statistics, the incidence of U.S. Army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the Iraq war.    Last year's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002, the year before the war in Iraq began, according to the Army.    The figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in March, Army officials said.    The Army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides. Suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths, compared with 87 in 2005.    Cameron-Ritchie, the Army psychiatrist, said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships, but they are also related to problems with work, finances and the law.    \"The really tough area here is stigma. We know that soldiers don't want to go seek care. They're tough, they're strong, they don't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider,\" Cameron-Ritchie said.    Multiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships, thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts, she said.    Traditionally, the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age- and gender-matched civilians. But in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006, she said. That's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000, she said.    The \"typical\" soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act, according to the Army.    Post-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts, Cameron-Ritchie said, because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse.    \"The real central issue is relationships. Relationships, relationships, relationships,\" said U.S. Army Chaplain Lt. Col. Ran Dolinger. \"People look at PTSD, they look at length of deployments ... but it's that broken relationship that really makes the difference.\"    To reduce suicides, the Army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been in Iraq for long periods and teaching them to notice signs that can lead to suicide.    That training came too late for Army Specialist Tim Bowman. The 23-year-old killed himself in 2005 after returning from Iraq.    \"As my family was preparing for a 2005 Thanksgiving meal, our son Timothy was lying on the floor, slowly bleeding to death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" said his father, Mike Bowman, in testimony to a House Veterans' Affairs committee hearing in December. \"His war was now over.\"    He said veterans return home to find an \"understaffed, under-funded, under-equipped\" Veterans Affairs mental health system.    \"Many just give up trying,\" he said.

Red, sky blue and orange pencil shavings glued onto a large canvas form a woman's traditional hair clip. A collage of magazine clippings, drawings and found materials depict Cambodia's tumultuous modern history.  Leang Seckon's \"Prison Guard\" depicts Duch, who is facing a genocide tribunal starting Tuesday.  These are a few of the offerings on hand in Hong Kong at one of the first large international exhibitions of artists from Cambodia. The work by 14 artists varies in practice-- video, photography, collage, wood shavings, paper, bamboo and painting-- as well as in themes, from reflecting on the Southeast Asian nation's genocidal Khmer Rouge regime to the emerging modern Cambodia, with traffic lights and all.  \"Every artist in this show is referencing ancient tradition and recent history,\" said Phnom Penh-based curator Erin Gleeson, noting the wall-size depiction in folded paper of the serpent Naga (which in Cambodian culture represents the people's mythical birth) to a collage of 20th-century Cambodia and its six different regime changes.  \"The show is looking at the present -- 'Forever Until Now' is the title -- and it is this lineage of the past, you see that in the show, and then you see artists that arrive at the present,\" she added.  The show opens Friday and runs through March 22 at 10 Chancery Lane Gallery. Gallery owner and director Katie de Tilly said she believed it was important the artists get international exposure.  \" ... it's really at the beginning of their art emergence. Obviously, they've had a very hard history,\" she said. \"This is really the beginning of contemporary Cambodians who are expressing very original ideas in their artworks and I think that that's what makes it very unique and to show to the rest of the world.\"  Cambodia, which lost an estimated one-quarter of its population or at least 1.7 million people -- including an estimated 90 percent of its artists -- under the 1970s Khmer Rouge regime, has a small but growing artistic community: there are some 50 practicing artists out of its 14 million people, Gleeson said.  The genocide and ensuing war, which only ended in the last decade or so, stifled the development of the arts in one of the world's poorest countries.  \"The legacy of that is now in every facet of a developing society,\" said Gleeson, who noted the country had no art books when she arrived in 2002 on a fellowship to teach art history. \"There's an absence of infrastructure for them, there's an absence of materials, there is no art store. ... they are quite inventive about mixing materials to make them of a higher quality or last longer, but in many cases they don't know archival techniques.\"  The harsh weather conditions -- a dusty, hot season and a rainy monsoon -- add to the trying work conditions.  \"Everything's against them,\" she added. \"Their parents in many cases are coming from a really disadvantaged background, as the majority of the country is economically.\"  Some of the art included in the show looks at the Cambodia of today, such as Leang Seckon's \"Three Greens\" -- an acrylic painting showing children in school uniform crossing a road with a yellow light, red light and three green lights, along with cows and roosters. The piece shows the changes in a country that recently got stop lights, with animals, people and traffic mingling on the main roads of the capital.  Sopheap Pich, a Cambodian-American whose family migrated to the U.S. in 1984, works with bamboo and rattan -- materials often used in Cambodian traditional farming and crafts -- to make sculptures.  His work, \"Cycle 2,\" is the joining of the stomachs of an infant and an elderly person that for him brought up ideas of Cambodian traditional village life.  \"You belong to each other, you help each other out,\" he said. \"But also, if you look at the lines and you see how it's shaped by hand, it's not very perfect, so it's also about struggle...  \"You could say it's a cycle of trying to hold onto each other, now we are living everywhere in the world, Cambodians are all over the planet,\" he added. \"All this technique and pattern that I am quite obsessed with ... it's about this idea of trying to hold on with very simple means.\"  Chan Dany, a 25-year-old artist who graduated from one of the country's three art schools, creates textured patterns that appear almost like tapestry using pencil shavings in various colors. The works on display in the show are from a series based on Cambodian architectural decor, such as door and window shutter carvings, and include ancient Khmer forms whose shapes are derived from nature.  \"When I started learning art, the teacher introduced a lot of new ways of making art, new ideas that were very difficult for me, so I had to think a lot,\" he said through a translator. \"So then I looked around at what my classmates were doing and I started to think about what they weren't using for their work, so I started to collect the things that they didn't use when they were making art and started to think about my way of making art using those materials.\"  \"I like the first piece I did (using the pencil shaving technique) because I had never done it this way before and since then I kept on making it,\" he said.  The younger artists \"seem to be expressing something more fresh,\" while the work by artists from the older generation is \"much more heavy,\" de Tilly said.  Some of the works of the Khmer Rouge period include a painting by Vann Nath, one of seven people to survive the regime's infamous S-21 torture prison. His painting, \"Pray for Peace,\" depicts women wearing traditional Cambodian funeral scarves praying en masse under troubled skies by stormy seas.  Another work, Leang's \"Prison Guard,\" tells the life of Duch, a former teacher who ran S-21 and goes on trial Tuesday before a U.N.-backed tribunal on charges that include crimes against humanity.  The art scene has been growing slowly in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh over the last few years: Sopheap started a group to promote contemporary Cambodian art practices and two art institutes offer programs apart from the Royal University of Fine Arts.  One factor that has also made Cambodian contemporary artists different from their counterparts, for example in neighboring Vietnam, has been the lack of outside influence, such as was the case with Chinese contemporary art 30 years ago, de Tilly said.  \"Cambodia still is very much influenced by itself and so the development is happening on a slower pace but as well very interesting,\" she said. \"They seem to not have as much international exposure to materials, magazines, publications, so you really do feel -- it was the same just after the Cultural Revolution in China -- that they didn't have exposure to many publications and things, and so their art was developing at that moment in time.\"  \" ... it's very interesting to document it and see what's going to happen in the future,\" she said.  Part of the exhibit will be shown at another of the gallery's venues in Hong Kong and will run through April 25."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4851362601dbc1e65e9fa10cd50a217e6dab0149.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What are leaving crops as dry as the landscape?", "id": "108116", "answers": [{"text": "winds ripping though the country,", "answer_start": 767}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Somalia is facing life-threatening food and water shortages leaving millions at risk for starvation, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Wednesday.

Humanitarian workers view Somalia's food crisis as one of the worst in the world. With winds ripping though the country, hundreds of thousands of Somalis are finding their crops as dry as the surrounding landscape, preventing harvests, killing livestock and leading to a mass risk of starvation.  The continual armed conflicts in central and south Somalia have aggravated the situation, hindering people from accessing shelter and medical attention.  A growing percentage of the population has become dependent on humanitarian aid.

The WFP will be increasing the amount it spends in Somalia to $163 million in food assistance, the group said at a U.N. conference in Rome Wednesday.  In addition to drought and armed conflict, high inflation on food and fuel have also exacerbated the situation.

Responding to the controversy surrounding a newly published remark he made privately about Obama's race in 2008, Reid sought to emphasize his longstanding support for the nation's first African-American president.      \"I can still remember the meeting that took place in my office with Sen. Barack Obama, telling him that I think he can be elected president,\" Reid said.      Obama \"was kind of surprised that the Democratic leader was calling this new senator over to suggest that he could be elected president,\" he added.      A new book quotes Reid, D-Nevada, as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could be successful as a black candidate in part because of his \"light-skinned\" appearance and speaking patterns \"with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.\"      Reid said Monday that numerous prominent African-American officials, including NAACP Chairman Julian Bond and Attorney General Eric Holder, have called him to offer support amid the controversy that began over the weekend.      \"I've apologized to everyone with the sound of my voice that I could have used a better choice of words,\" he said after an event announcing a new energy project in his home state. \"And I'll continue doing my work for the African-American community.\"      Reid said that \"as a very young man,\" he became a leader of civil rights efforts, including the integration of the gaming community.      He added that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called him to say he should \"tell everybody that you have done more for diversity in the United States Senate than all the rest of the people put together.\"      Asked whether he should apologize to voters, Reid -- who had issued a statement over the weekend apologizing \"for offending any and all Americans\" -- did not answer directly and instead cited the support he has received from around the country and within his own state.      \"I'm not going to dwell on this any more,\" Reid said. \"It's in the book. I've made all the statements I'm going to make.\"      iReport: What do you think about the words Reid used?      The book he referred to, \"Game Change,\" went on sale Monday. The authors write that \"Reid was convinced, in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination.\"      Reid apologized in a statement sent to CNN over the weekend. \"I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words,\" he said.      He added, \"I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans, for my improper comments. I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda.\"      Reid called the president Saturday and apologized. In a statement issued after the call, Obama expressed support for Reid, saying, \"As far as I am concerned, the book is closed.\"      Speaking to CNN contributor Roland Martin, Obama described Reid as \"a friend of mine. He has been a stalwart champion of voting rights, civil rights.\"      \"This is a good man who has always been on the right side of history. For him to have used some inartful language in trying to praise me and for people to try and make hay out of that makes absolutely no sense,\" he said in the interview, which will air this month.      \"I guarantee you the average person, white or black, right now is less concerned about what Harry Reid said in a quote in a book a couple of years ago than they are about how we are going to move the country forward, and that's where we need to direct our attention.\"      A senior administration official said Monday that Obama will go to Nevada in February to campaign on behalf of Reid.      iReporter: \"I don't think he should be kicked out of the Senate\"      Reid also called a host of African-American political figures, including House Democrats Barbara Lee of California and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina; the Rev. Al Sharpton; CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile; and the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Wade Henderson.      Republicans pounced on the controversy.      Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, called for Reid to give up his leadership posts after the \"embarrassing and racially insensitive\" remarks.      Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele, speaking Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" also called for Reid to step down. \"Racism and racist conversations have no place today in America,\" the first African-American GOP chairman said.      Steele also was on the defensive for a remark he made last week.      Speaking to Fox News, Steele said the GOP platform \"is one of the best political documents that's been written in the last 25 years, honest Injun on that.\"      \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace said lawmakers from both parties have called that a racial slur.      \"Well, if it is, I apologize for it. It's not an intent to be a racial slur. I wasn't intending to say a racial slur at all,\" Steele said.      iReporter: Mixing race and politics equals trouble      Numerous Democrats came to Reid's defense. The Congressional Black Caucus said Sunday that it had accepted his apology and dismissed calls for the Nevada Democrat to step down.      \"Sen. Reid's record provides a stark contrast to actions of Republicans to block legislation that would benefit poor and minority communities,\" Lee, chairwoman of the caucus, said in a written statement.      Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, a former chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, issued a statement saying, \"Like President Barack Obama, African-Americans are likely to accept Majority Leader Reid's apology for an obvious reason. He has earned it.\"      She added, \"Harry Reid's opponents will not find a welcome mat in the black community if they seek to capitalize on the Reid remark. While Sen. Reid has been producing for African-Americans, many of his critics were opposing him on these same issues.\"      Democrats rejected a parallel drawn by some Republicans between Reid's remark and one by former Sen. Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, in 2002. Lott lost his post as Senate majority leader after saying the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had been elected president. Thurmond had run as a segregationist candidate in 1948.      \"There is a big double standard here,\" Steele said on NBC. \"When Democrats get caught saying racist things, you know, an apology is enough.\"      Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, shot back, telling NBC that \"there is no comparison\" between the two sets of remarks.      Reid is embroiled in a tough re-election campaign to stay in the Senate. Only one-third of Nevada voters have a favorable opinion of him, while 52 percent have an unfavorable opinion of the four-term senator, according to a survey by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research for the Las Vegas Review-Journal released over the weekend.      The poll was conducted Tuesday through Thursday, before news of Reid's comments broke.

As the chancellor of one of the nation's lowest-performing school districts, she says she has no choice -- too much bureaucracy to cut through, too many problems to fix after decades of neglect.    Michelle Rhee says a sense of urgency has been missing for years in the District of Columbia's schools.    Rhee closed 23 schools in her first year as the head of the District of Columbia's public schools, fired 36 principals and cut 15 percent -- about 121 jobs -- from the central office staff. And she's making no apologies.    \"I think it's that sense of urgency that has been lacking for far too long in our public schools,\" Rhee told CNN as she began her second year on the job in late August.    \"We are always going to put the best interests of kids above the rights, privileges and priorities of adults.\"  Watch fighting for \"radical changes\" \u00bb    Rhee said \"radical\" changes are needed because only 12 percent of the District's eighth graders are proficient in reading and just 8 percent are proficient in math, but was quick to add that they're already seeing improvement. She highlighted gains in elementary reading and secondary level math and reading in the past year that outstripped all of the four prior years put together.    An annual report card by Education Week, a newspaper that follows the nation's education system, earlier this year ranked the District's school system last, giving it a D+ overall and an F for student achievement in kindergarten through 12th grade. Those grades were based on data prior to Rhee's arrival.    \"We need to see radical changes because the outcomes for kids that are happening right now are robbing them of their futures,\" said Rhee, a Democrat who supports President Bush's landmark education law known as No Child Left Behind.  Watch Rhee describe telling employee: \"You need to find another job\" \u00bb    \"We have scores of kids in this city who don't have the advocates that they need in their lives who are able to maneuver and jockey through the public school system. And we can't allow those children to languish in classrooms where teachers are not performing.\"    Her plan is ambitious: To completely transform the District's system within eight years for its 50,000 children. The plan focuses on top-down accountability, quantitative results like standardized test scores and, ultimately, working to close what she describes as \"the achievement gap between wealthy white kids and poor minority kids.\"    \"I think it's absolutely possible within an eight-year period,\" she said.  Watch D.C. schools need \"urgency\" \u00bb    Rhee, who is Korean-American, is operating in a largely African-American district. It is a district where 57 percent of the students qualify for the free or reduced lunch program. Rhee said when she first arrived on the job in 2007 she first heard whispers of: \"She's not from D.C., she's not African-American: Is she going to be able to relate to students and their families?\"    \"I think that all dissipated quite quickly after I started getting out into the community and talking to people,\" said Rhee, a 38-year-old mother of two children attending local public schools. \"I think one of the things that comes across very clearly is the fact that I'm very passionate about this work. I'm very focused on it.\"    But her plan to turn the failing school district on its head has met protest every step of the way, even from teachers.    \"I think the people who view her aggressive actions as a positive thing, I think they are missing the boat because if it results in more chaos and more dysfunction, it's not the solution that we need,\" said Kerry Sylvia, a teacher at Cardozo Senior High School in her ninth year.    Sylvia says the District has seen far too many superintendents over the years and fears Rhee is just another in the long list of those who come in touting their reforms and then leave.    She does offer praise for Rhee holding teachers and administrators accountable for their lack of performance. However, she doesn't always care for Rhee's style, saying Rhee makes it seem like \"there's a lot of lazy teachers.\"    \"She's pitting adults against children. She couches things in terms of 'I'm not here to keep jobs for adults. I'm not here to keep people's paychecks. I am here for the children,' \" Sylvia said. \"Well, guess what? I'm here for the children too.\"    Before taking on her current role, Rhee founded The New Teacher Project, a non-profit organization that recruits quality teachers to high-poverty schools. Rhee holds a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University.    One of the most controversial programs Rhee has introduced is a joint venture between D.C. schools and Harvard that pays middle school students cash -- up to $100 a month -- for good behavior and attendance.    Rhee says such pilot programs have worked in other cities. She says the District's students have far too many bad incentives on the streets, from hustling to drug dealing, and need something to keep them focused.    \"We're preparing them to understand that if you do the right thing, then good things will happen to you,\" Rhee said.    Some in the District are skeptical, including Clarence Cherry, a fourth-generation Washingtonian and father of five. He calls the cash and Rhee's overall direction misguided and reckless.    \"It's a very dangerous game that she's playing with,\" he said.    But Cherry added, \"I want to give her an opportunity to prove to me as a parent that she genuinely ... is here for the kids.\"    Others are fervent supporters of the new superintendent. Dr. Waheedah Shakoor, another teacher at Cardozo, has been in the District since 1979. He says he's been stunned at the amount of change that's happened in just one year under Rhee, from freshly painted walls to improved athletic facilities.    \"Things that we've been asking for for many, many years have come to fruition within just the last 12 months,\" Shakoor said.    Rhee is an appointee of Mayor Adrian Fenty, who has backed her every move.    \"I had the highest expectations of Michelle Rhee when she came into the job. She has exceeded every expectation,\" Fenty said. \"When you have a system that's been as underperforming as the District of Columbia public schools, you need to shake things up.\"    Rhee says she'll continue to shake things, working at break-neck speed to improve the education and opportunity for her students and urban students across the country as fast as she can."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/086bfc14f8388cb3ba19b66990b6a39ec2fe8834.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did he do as teen with Robert De Niro?", "id": "108131", "answers": [{"text": "appeared on \"The Sopranos\" and played alongside", "answer_start": 215}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Lillo Brancato Jr., an actor who appeared in \"The Sopranos,\" was acquitted of the 2005 killing an off-duty New York City police officer but found guilty of attempted burglary.

He has already served three years, according to his attorney, Joseph Tacopina.  Police officer Daniel Enchautegui, 28, was killed trying to break up a burglary attempt at his neighbor's house in the Bronx in December 2005.  During the trial, Brancato said there was not a break-in. Brancato said he knew the owner of the home, and that he and friend Steven Armento, 51, were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium.  Brancato told the jury that the owner, a Vietnam veteran, gave him permission to come to his house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted.  Brancato admitted to breaking a window at the home, but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and he said he was trying to wake up his friend to get the drugs.  When Brancato and Armento entered the home, the next door neighbor -- Enchautegui -- came outside to investigate.  That's when prosecutors said Armento shot the officer through the heart with his .357 Magnum.  Armento was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in November. The jury in that trial took less than six hours to convict Armento.  Enchautegui was shot in the chest by Armento when he interrupted the alleged robbery, but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying.  \"This jury spoke loud and clear, that Lillo had nothing to do with the murder of this police officer,\" Tacopina said.

The show will air Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m., noon and 4 p.m.    Clark Howard says there are good bargains in store for those who wait until January to shop.    ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Retailers have received the biggest lumps of coal in their Christmas stockings in memory.    Americans have been on a buyers' strike all fall and have not been interested in 50 percent off sales, doorbusters or any other promotions to get them to pry open their wallets. In a normal year when Christmas season sales are strong, retailers offer whatever they have left after the holiday, just the unloved stuff that didn't sell, at incredible markdowns.    This year is different.    You may get some bargains after Christmas, but if you want really rock-bottom prices, wait until January 5. Retailers are going to be stuck with massive amounts of goods and those will be reduced to fire sale prices. If you have money that you can afford to part with, get out there the first full week of the New Year. Everything from electronics to clothing to appliances to furniture will be a deal.    Be careful if you shop from December 26 through January 4. The bargains are mostly fake ones during those 10 days because patterns are completely disrupted by gift cards. Most people are off from work between Christmas and New Years, have the time to shop and have the gift cards burning a hole in their wallets.    Stores are able to \"pretend\" to offer bargains in the immediate after-Christmas period and people feel like they \"have\" to spend right away with store credit from returns and that gift card dough. As a result, the discounts are relatively small. However, follow my way and your wallet will really smile on you.    Wait to do returns until after the 5th and those long return lines are gone. Retailers usually give 14 or so days after Christmas to do returns so you are still OK on the deadline and you don't have to wait in lines, which I avoid like the plague.    Then think about it: You get the pick of all the merchandise that people returned that has been marked down and you get access to all the stuff that didn't sell that is on final clearance. But that's not all: I love January shopping because you have the stores virtually to yourself. My favorite time to go is Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night when you will find more employees than customers in the stores.    I do have a special warning about all those gift cards.    A lot of retailers that have been selling gift cards this season are not going to make it. Expect a wave of retailer bankruptcies in January, February and March. Over and over again bankruptcy court judges have wiped out the value of gift cards. Don't let your's lie around in a drawer gathering dust after Christmas. Use them over the next month before they go bad.    Speaking of stores going bust, don't get fooled by \"Going Out of Business\" sales, known in the lingo of the trade as GOB's. They are as phony as a $3 bill. When any chain store goes broke, they hire a specialist company known as a liquidator.    The liquidator is the one who puts those big going out of business sale banners on the stores and pays those guys to stand on street corners holding signs that say 40 percent, 50 percent, even 60 percent off. But the deals are usually fake. Many liquidators will sell the store's merchandise at a discount, but usually not as good as prices on a regular sale.    The real money is made by the liquidator in many cases by bringing in what I call \"fake\" goods. They are not literally fake, just things that were never sold in the store in the first place. Those items are priced with high prices that are then \"discounted\" 50 percent or more to fool you into thinking you are getting a real deal.

Instead, they say the ominous jagged lines on their arms mean \"Germans never surrender.\"    It is a twisted interpretation that, however misguided, gives strength to Brian, marking him as a \"man\" and \"someone who does not surrender,\" he said quietly in a soft voice.  Watch the boys explain what the tattoos mean to them \u00bb    Brian and his young compatriots from Zimbabwe are on their own in a new country. Charities such as Save the Children and UNICEF classify them as \"unaccompanied minors,\" but those words do not begin to describe their situation.    They endure unimaginable hardships traveling to South Africa by themselves or with small groups of friends. They hitch rides on trucks, trains and taxis.    Brian and his friends told CNN that when they got to the South African border at Beitbridge authorities let them walk through without passports or other documents.    They then made their way to the border town of Musina, where boys beg on the streets or work on farms, and girls seem to disappear into South African society.    UNICEF representative Shantha Bloemen said many Zimbabwean girls either turn to prostitution or work as domestic servants.    Nearly all of the children -- some younger than 10 -- leave Zimbabwe because they hope their life will be better in South Africa. They said hunger, non-functioning schools and poverty were the reasons they left.    Many are orphans, while some have parents, but they all dislike Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's regime -- a government that has left them with no choice but to abandon their homes and join the exodus south.    A quarter of Zimbabwe's population has fled the country, mostly to neighboring South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique, humanitarian groups said.    The United Nations and Save the Children, which has an office based in Musina, report there has been a troubling increase in the number of children under 18 years old who are making the risky journey south from their homes in Zimbabwe to South Africa in search of work and food.    Social workers from Save the Children and UNICEF told CNN that in June, 175 Zimbabwean children came over the border illegally and alone. In November, 1,016 kids made the same perilous journey.    The boys older than 16 hang around Musina, sleeping on the sidewalk by a sports stadium along with older homeless men. Their days are spent waiting in line, jostling alongside hundreds of Zimbabwean adults, trying to apply for political asylum at a makeshift center opened by South African authorities.    A South African official who processes asylum applications says it is common for youngsters to lie about their age so they can get the papers to stay in the country legally.    Many, though, cannot get the necessary papers because they do not carry documentation or have adults who can vouch for who they are and where they come from.    So, they wander the streets, begging for money.    The younger ones like Brian are picked up by police and housed in a safe place until authorities and aid agencies can figure out what to do with them.    While they wait for a future that never seems to arrive, boys like Brian and Temashi -- a legacy of Mugabe's regime -- struggle to survive in the world they now find themselves in."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/cd34ece89ee1969f4905892136244433da67e817.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does the 12 hr shift involved?", "id": "108141", "answers": [{"text": "backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards.", "answer_start": 3074}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York.

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Whenever someone at our office bitches about being overworked, our stock response is \"Beats digging ditches.\"      While the express intention of the statement is usually not-so-supportive, we think it's a healthy reminder that at the end of the day, we are all basically professional e-mailers and should be thankful for such.      The wildland firefighters who work for Grayback Forestry in Medford, Oregon, have no such motivational adages because their job is actually digging ditches. Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business.      Southern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze.      Flying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 \"Biscuit\" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar.      See more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV      There are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest.      We spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call \"project work\" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards. Which we do not.

Musk ox in the Arctic check the spread of shrubs to the High Arctic, but promote grass growth.    That's the message from Eric Post, lead scientist of a new report into the effects of climate change on life in the Arctic.    Published in \"Science\" magazine, Post and his team of international scientist conducted the study during the fourth International Polar Year that ended in 2008.    \"It seems no matter where you look -- on the ground, in the air, or in the water -- we're seeing signs of rapid change,\" said Post in a press statement.    The report found that flora and fauna of the Arctic are responding in various ways to the region's changes in climate over the last 150 years, and more recently the 20 to 30 years where seasonal minimal sea ice coverage has declined by 45,000 square kilometers per year.    With the decline in sea ice and snow, animals usually seen at lower latitudes are being found in more northerly regions, including red foxes that have been displacing native Arctic foxes.  View the gallery of Arctic life affected by climate change \u00bb    The report found that some native Arctic species have also benefited from climate change, including wild reindeer on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.    With less snow cover and a longer growing season, these non-migratory reindeer have taken advantage of the increased plant abundance, with the result that reindeer populations and their ability to reproduce are up, while mortality is down.    But other animals are not adapting well to rising temperatures and the effect on delicate ecosystems.    Migratory caribou in low Arctic Greenland and elsewhere are declining in number as they have not been able to keep their calving season in synch with changes in plant growth.    With the decline in caribou comes a knock-on effect to native Inuit hunters, according to the report's authors. Hotter summers could result in more insects and parasites that prey on the caribou, which could then also reduce the annual caribou harvest by local indigenous peoples.    \"Inuit hunters at my study site in Greenland have all but given up on hunting caribou there. What will be the next component to disappear from their traditional lifestyle, a lifestyle that has worked for thousands of years?\" said Post.    Iconic Arctic animals dependent sea ice, including Pacific walrus, ringed seal, hooded seal, ivory gull, narwhal and polar bear, are faring especially badly, said the report.    The researchers found that polar bears and ringed seals, both of which give birth in lairs or caves under the snow, lose many newborn pups when the lairs collapse in unusually early spring rains. These species may be headed for extinction, said the report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/488038ebd6c655b1a89b5a9304b8fc51c0778cec.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the 8 year old boy suspected of?", "id": "108148", "answers": [{"text": "shooting deaths of his father and another", "answer_start": 59}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- The mother of an 8-year-old boy suspected in the shooting deaths of his father and another man said Monday that the youngster \"loved his dad\" and had a strong relationship with him.    \"He's a very good little boy,\" Eryn Bloomfield said on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" \"What happened to being innocent until proven guilty?\"    For legal reasons, Bloomfield -- who is identified in court papers as Eryn Thomas -- could not discuss details of the case. She said she is not even allowed to discuss the case with her son.    Prosecutors in Apache County, Arizona, filed a motion Friday to dismiss one of the two murder charges against the boy -- the charge involving the death of his father. The filing gave no explanation, saying only, \"The state believes the interest of justice will be served by such a dismissal.\"    Authorities last week released a videotape of the boy's police interview in which he initially denied any involvement in the shootings, but later said he had shot his already-wounded father \"because he was suffering.\"  Watch the boy talk to police \u00bb    Legal questions surround the interview. One of the boy's defense attorneys said he was not read his rights and had no attorney or parent present. Police have not responded publicly to those complaints.    Asked what she heard on the interview tape, Bloomfield responded, \"A scared little boy, that's what I hear -- someone who's very afraid of what's going on.\"    \"He had a very good relationship with his father. He did a lot with him,\" she said. \"They did everything together. He loved his dad.\"    She described her son as \"very outgoing. He loves animals. He likes to ride his dirt bike, skateboarding, you know, outdoor things.\"    Asked if he's ever been in trouble at school, she replied, \"No. Not at all. I mean, acting out as far as not raising your hand when he needs to speak -- you know, just normal stuff like that.\"    The boy lived with his father, Vincent Romero, 29, in St. Johns, Arizona. Bloomfield lives in Mississippi.    The Apache County Superior Court clerk's office said the latest legal agreement between the boy's parents was from April 2006. The mother had weekly visitation rights and had the boy on some weekends and holidays, according to court documents.    Romero and Tim Romans, who rented a room in Romero's home, were found dead inside the house November 5. Police said the next day that the boy had confessed to shooting the men with a .22-caliber weapon.  Watch why observers find the interrogation troubling \u00bb    The killings shook the town of about 4,000 residents near the New Mexico border.    Trying to hold back tears, Bloomfield told ABC that her son is scared and living alone at a juvenile detention center. The other children were removed so that older juveniles could not influence him \"in the wrong way,\" she said.    \"So he's in there by himself, in his cell by himself,\" she said.    Authorities have said the boy is attending school at the detention facility. Apache County Court Administrator Betty Smith said earlier this month, \"Every effort is being made to see that he's comfortable.\"    Bloomfield described heart-wrenching visits -- 30 minutes each day -- when she can speak to her son through a glass partition.    \"I get two visits with him that are physical visits -- to where we sit in a room and he will come and sit in my lap pretty much the whole time and hold onto me,\" she added.    She will be allowed 48 hours with him at home over the Thanksgiving holiday, she said.    \"We're going to watch movies, play games, try to keep things normal as possible,\" she said, adding that the boy had picked out the movie \"Kung Fu Panda.\"    Officials from the juvenile detention center and a court-appointed guardian will be present during the visit, Smith said. According to a report in The Arizona Republic, Judge Michael Roca warned the media not to contact the juvenile.    \"The minor is off-limits,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"I think common decency should protect him, but, just in case, he is not to be contacted.\"    Asked what she'll say to him on Thanksgiving, Bloomfield answered, \"I tell him every day that I love him, and I don't know how much more I can express that, but I definitely plan on doing that -- just to let him know that I'm here for him and how much I do love him.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/8d7e008c066f416dcf1f40286a2e15b26303e7fa.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended?", "id": "108149", "answers": [{"text": "that doctors screen children for autism during regular checkups at the ages of 18 and 24 months.", "answer_start": 415}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- A report from Canadian researchers published Monday says there is not enough sound evidence to support routine screening of children for autism, but several autism experts are questioning the paper's conclusions.      The article, published in the journal Pediatrics, is based on a review of existing studies.      Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics -- which publishes the journal -- recommends that doctors screen children for autism during regular checkups at the ages of 18 and 24 months.      The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 110 children has some form of autism, a handful of different neuro-developmental disorders that cause mild to severe social, communication and behavioral problems.      Monday's report questions whether screening for autism is the right approach.      \"Good screening tools and efficacious treatment [for autism] is lacking,\" it says, adding that \"none of the autism screening tests currently available has been shown to be able to fulfill the properties of accuracy.\"      The report's authors are cerebral palsy experts at McMaster University in Ontario.      But several leading autism experts -- who diagnose, treat and study children with autism -- said they were puzzled and concerned by the new report's conclusions.      \"By screening for autism at an early age, children are able to begin intervention as soon as possible,\" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the Autism Speaks advocacy group. \"Studies have shown that early intervention results in significant increases in cognitive and language abilities, and adaptive behavior, and gives children the best chance for a positive outcome.\"      Dr. Patricia Manning-Courtney, a developmental pediatrician and the director of the autism center at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, said the study goes completely \"against the experience in this field\" in which experts have said early intervention or therapy can yield the most benefits for a child later in life.      \"I have never, ever met a family that regretted being told their child may have symptoms -- not a single family,\" she said.      If a diagnosis of autism is later found to be inaccurate, the child isn't harmed by the therapy given in the interim, she said.      But Manning-Courtney said she's met thousands of parents whose children were diagnosed at an older age \"who wished they were listened to sooner.\"      Dr. Charles Cowan, medical director of the Seattle Children's Autism Center, echoed Manning-Courtney's concerns, saying the report's conclusions seem to negate well established research and recommendations from people who treat children with autism, including the American Academy of Pediatrics.      More research is needed, he said, but just because all the necessary research hasn't been done yet, it \"does not negate the benefit of screening.\"      Dr. Paul Lipkin, who chaired the academy's 2006 committee that recommended the screenings at 18 and 24 months, said the conclusions in Monday's report overlooked significant benefits to screening.      Doctors are also identifying problems beyond autism, including a wide range of developmental disorders, he said.      Lipkin, the director of the Center for Development and Learning at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, acknowledged that screening tools aren't perfect, but noted that doctors combine them with continuous surveillance.      \"We are hoping that the combination can then overcome any of the limits of the tests or surveillance. The combination is better than either one of them,\" he said, adding that some newer studies, not cited in the Canadian study, suggest that \"it does look like we're on the right track.\"      Despite the apparent criticisms of screening in Monday's article, study author Dr. Jan Willem Gorter said he and his co-authors were not specifically referring to \"the surveillance that is happening in doctors' offices\" at 18 and 24 months.      They were recommending against a population-wide screening program that would require screening every child at a certain age level for autism, he said. Nobody is conducting such a study at this time in the United States.      Results from a South Korean study of that nature published last month in the American Journal of Psychiatry suggested 1 in 38 children had autism -- a much higher number than previously believed. Some experts questioned the accuracy of those  results, which were based on screening of 55,000 12-year-old children in South Korea, suggesting that the screening may have picked up other developmental delays, not just autism.      Last month, the CDC told CNN it was considering a total population study of autism, but no such study is currently underway.      Gorter said he and his colleagues did not include the South Korean study in their analysis, but he said it showed \"exactly why we wrote the paper.\"      He said he and his co-authors based their suggestions on what they learned from children with cerebral palsy, and that his ultimate goal is to \"find the children who truly have autism and find ways to help them.\"      Screening isn't the only issue touched on in Monday's paper.      The article also finds \"little support for the effectiveness for speech and language therapy for people with autism,\" argues that \"applied behavior intervention did not significantly improve the cognitive outcomes of children\" and says that \"screening is pointless, and almost certainly unethical.\"      Susan Martin, director of media relations for the American Academy of Pediatrics, pointed to the academic journal's disclaimer, which says statements and opinions in the articles it publishes \"are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the AAP.\"      But several autism specialists said they feared the theoretical questions the article poses would turn back the clock to a time when parents' concerns about their childrens' development weren't heard.      Cowan said Monday's report completely leaves out studies that have shown benefits for children in cognitive and social developments. He cites a study published by Dawson and Sally Rogers, which found giving toddlers as young as 18 months old intensive therapy by trained specialists and their parents, can effectively improve the child's IQ, social interaction and ability to communicate.      Cowan called that study a \"landmark (clinical) trial\" and said he was surprised the Canadian researchers did not include it.      Manning-Courtney, who is also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the study could be misinterpreted by some, \"especially insurance companies,\" which may decide they don't have to pay for costly, lengthy autism therapies if a study says that \"efficacious treatments are lacking.\"      But Gorter said the study's authors want to \"help improve the outcome for the children's lives.\"      \"I would hope our debate would lead to an action,\" he said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/68707273090b953ec98884b3f4bfa03f75c437f0.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "are overlappers trusted?", "id": "108151", "answers": [{"text": "deceive", "answer_start": 1409}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(The Frisky) -- When I asked an old friend why she hadn't just broken up with her live-in boyfriend instead of beginning a messy affair with a married neighbor, she snapped, \"Don't be stupid -- nobody leaves a relationship without having another one in place.\"    Overlappers refuse to end one relationship until they have another one in progress.    Oh, please, I corrected her. Of course they do. People fall out of love or get angry and leave without a safety net all the time. But as I thought back, I realized that for as long as I knew her, she never had.    Even when she pretty much hated the one she was with, she stuck it out until she'd lined up his replacement. I could never understand why. My friend is beautiful, successful and very smart; surely being single for a little while wouldn't end her world.    Women aren't the only ones guilty of this. I know -- and have unfortunately dated -- plenty of men who careen from one girlfriend directly into another, often with a big fat overlap; connecting the two relationships like a murky Venn diagram. I understand that being single can be annoying and lonely sometimes, but there are plenty of good reasons not to be -- or date! -- an Overlapper.    1. Karma! While overlapping is definitely cheating, the difference is these types go into it with the sole purpose of transitioning into another relationship. But however you word it, Overlappers deceive one or both parties in order to get what they want. When you begin a relationship dishonestly, it usually comes back to bite you in the butt.    At the very least, you will never be fully able to trust an Overlapper. Because -- as yet another cliche based in truth goes -- if he does it with you, he'll do it to you.    2. Drama! Breakups are never fun, however splits caused by infidelity are hands down the most explosive.    If you're like my friend and her man (who, against all odds, actually left his wife), this means that instead of talking about hearts, flowers, and butterflies -- like other new couples -- you spend your nights plotting how to hide assets and whether or not your overpaid lawyer is enough of a shark. How romantic!    3. The Pressure! Though they may appear independent, people who can't be alone are that way because they need to see themselves reflected in someone else's adoring eyes.    But when their mirror (aka, partner) develops a flaw (weight gain, job loss, etc.), their image of themselves reflects that. Being a narcissist, nothing less than perfection is acceptable, so they start looking for the next mirror. Got that, fatty? You'd better stay at the top of your game if you want to hang onto an Overlapper.    4. Not cute! \"I met my boyfriend when his puppy peed on my foot\" is the perfect example of a meet-cute story. It has all the key elements -- chance, humor, and, best of all, a cuddly puppy!    \"I met my boyfriend because I was his kids' nanny and then his wife found out, which is how I got this black eye,\" is definitely not a tale you're going to want to share at parties.

Five hours later, Smith (@TheJetOnTNT) tweets a follow-up: \"Man, i think im gonna be sore.\" By Monday morning, though, he seems raring to go again: \"Im not sore today! the workout didnt kill me... Im back!!\"    Welcome to today's intersection of sports and social networking, where college athletes, professional players and even broadcasters use tools like Facebook and Twitter to share their thoughts and experiences with fans.    \"Sports personalities are tweeting now. They are giving fans a reason to tune in to see their comments,\" says Adam Ostrow, managing editor of Mashable, a blog devoted to online social media.    Ostrow believes social networking sites like Twitter allow athletes to connect directly with fans without the filter of the traditional media. And while many athletes and teams have blogs and Facebook profiles, Twitter allows for a more personal connection between fan and sports, he says.    NBA All-Star Shaquille O'Neal (@THE_REAL_SHAQ) is both a prolific scorer and a prolific twitterer. His more than 700,000 followers get his tweets about everything from his diet to his recent trip to Graceland.    Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong (@lancearmstrong) has more than 650,000 Twitter followers for such updates as \"Eating pizza at home w/ the family. Good test today, kids go home tomorrow (sad), and a hellacious week of training coming up.\"    Hockey players also are getting into the act. Washington Capitals ace Alex Ovechkin (@ovi8) was on Twitter during the NHL All-Star game in January, tweeting about the festivities and responding to fan questions and comments.    One athlete, Milwaukee Bucks forward Charlie Villanueva (@CV31), even got into hot water after tweeting during halftime of a game last month. Villanueva's entry read: \"In da locker room, snuck to post my twitt. We're playing the Celtics, tie ball game at da half. Coach wants more toughness. I gotta step up.\"    He did. Villanueva finished with a team-high 19 points, and the Bucks won.    Now sports announcers are using Twitter to talk to fans about everything from game action to what they do when the cameras are off. Fox Sports (@MLBonFox) baseball commentators and reporters are using Twitter to share tidbits from players and behind-the-scenes moments that the normal fan may not even think about.    Fox play-by-play announcer Joe Buck, one of the network's wittier twitterers, shared this recent tender moment from the broadcast booth: \"Joe Buck: Cold in the booth in STL. Tim [McCarver] and I are bundled up. And snuggling. Hard to type. I think hypothermia is starting to set in!\"    TNT is using the same approach to connect with basketball fans during the current NBA playoffs. Eleven members of the network's broadcast team have joined Twitter to provide insight into games, offer nuggets from players and solicit fan opinions.    \"TNT is an interesting experiment if they add analysis they don't give on TV,\" said Ostrow of Mashable. \"More interesting if they give more non-basketball info.\"    And they are. When Kenny Smith started on Twitter, he wasn't really sure what it was or how it would work. So he just answered the default question on his page: What are you doing?    \"I want to have some fun with it,\" Smith told CNN. \"I love scavenger hunts. I might leave tickets to the conference finals somewhere and leave clues on my Twitter.\"    Twitter gives announcers another way to connect with sports fans, Smith said.    \"You can give an attitude [on Twitter],\" he said. \"They can hear you on the air, but [on Twitter, they] get to hear your voice.\"    Smith hopes to continue revealing \"behind-the-scenes\" details in his tweets, because he wants his more than 1,000 followers to feel like they are there. And he plans to continue twittering beyond the NBA playoffs.    Increasingly, sports fans use social networking to talk back. For the Stanley Cup playoffs, the NHL recently organized \"tweetups\" where Twitter users met face-to-face to talk about whatever brought them together. Events were organized in 21 cities in the United States and Canada.    Laura Astorian, a self-described hockey blogger who follows the St. Louis Blues and Atlanta Thrashers, helped organize an NHL tweetup in Atlanta, Georgia. She said even though the city's hockey-fan base is relatively small, the fans rely on each other and use social networking sites like Twitter to communicate.    \"The people who did come enjoyed the chance to sit down and talk hockey with like-minded people,\" Astorian said. \"We did have fun, and there was mention of using the tweetup strategy for our draft party in July.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/bb793bd352d5f327ca8581d1fae45012b0bcc665.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When is CNN Student News on?", "id": "108154", "answers": [{"text": "4 a.m.", "answer_start": 611}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "CNN Student News -- Welcome to CNN Student News, a daily commercial-free, ten-minute broadcast of the day's news geared for middle- and high-school students.

Turkish troops patrol near the border with Iraq on Monday.    President Bush chatted by phone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while separately two senior Iraq national government figures met with the head of the country's Kurdish region.    The diplomatic moves came after Turkish warplanes pounded Kurdish separatist targets in northern Iraq on Saturday and Sunday as well as last week.    Bush and Erdogan talked about the dangers of the Kurdish separatist rebels along the Turkish-Iraqi border, the White House confirmed.    National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said they discussed their common efforts to fight terrorism, and the importance of the United States, Turkey and Iraq working together to confront the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK.    Bush has vowed to help Turkey fight PKK rebels.    The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey, with some of its attacks launched from inside northern Iraq. The United States and European Union consider the group a terrorist organization.    Last week, Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Nabi Sensoy, said his country's maneuvers against Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq were based on intelligence provided by the United States.    In the Kurdish Iraq city of Sulaimaniya, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, and Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is Sunni Arab, met with Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani.    Iraqi Kurdish officials, while critical of the PKK, have denounced the Turkish bombing campaign. Last week, Barzani snubbed visiting U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in protest of the attacks.    \"We have vehemently condemned the bombardment. The bombing targeted safe and secure areas and innocent people. Several people were either killed or wounded,\" Barzani said on Monday at a press conference with the others.    \"We held consultations with President Jalal Talabani and we will continue our consultations with other concerned parties to put an end to these aggressions and put to an end the shelling of villages.\"    The three Iraqi officials also dealt with national unity. They signed a \"memorandum of understanding\" to deepen relations further with their three parties: Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party and al-Hashimi's Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni Arab entity.

The number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan, like this bombing in April, has more than quadrupled from 2006 to 2008.      But the State Department annual terrorism report notes an overall decline in attacks worldwide and fewer attacks in Iraq.      The attacks worldwide have decreased by 20 percent, with 30 percent fewer fatalities, said Russell Travers of the National Counterterrorism Center.      The report says al Qaeda and its extremist supporters have moved across the Afghan border \"to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier, where they have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide, train terrorists, communicate with the followers, plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan.\"      In Pakistan alone, the report says, attacks more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2008, with a sharp increase in their \"coordination, sophistication and frequency.\" Last year there were 1,839 terrorist \"incidents,\" compared with 890 in 2007, Travers said.      The rise in violence has complicated the Obama administration's effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries.      The report says the largest number of attacks occurred in Pakistani provinces near the Afghan border, including Balochistan, the North West Frontier and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend Islamic law.      It also notes the government's inability to get a handle on the extremists. Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces, it says, \"the government of Pakistan's authority in the area continued to be challenged.\"      Ronald Schlicher, the State Department's acting coordinator of counterterrorism, told reporters the Obama administration has \"real concerns\" that al Qaeda's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States.      \"We have a real sense that it's happening, but we have imperfect knowledge of what they're doing,\" he said.      Pakistan's military in the past week launched an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The deal, criticized by the United States, allowed the Taliban to implement Islamic law, or sharia, in the region in exchange for an end to fighting.      The recent operations are part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan. The strikes have rankled relations between the two countries.      Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters, communication equipment and night-vision technology as part of a U.S. plan to beef up the country's counterterrorism efforts.      President Obama told reporters Wednesday night that he is \"gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan.\"      Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office, Obama said the United States has \"huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable\" and doesn't end up a \"nuclear-armed militant state.\"      After making two visits to Pakistan in less than three weeks, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, is \"very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in Pakistan and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships' inability to confront that threat,\" according to his chief spokesman.      Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have called Taliban gains in Pakistan an \"existential threat\" to the country.      The State Department report notes the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, in November, attributing them to the Pakistan-based Kashmir terrorist group Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and to its fundraising subsidiary, amaat ud-Dawa. Although Pakistan has cracked down on some of the groups' camps and made several arrests, the report warned of continuing tension between India and Pakistan.      The report says Afghanistan is plagued by \"an insurgency that more and more relied on vicious and increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks,\" despite the efforts of NATO forces and the Afghan government.      \"The anti-government insurgency remained a capable, determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority,\" the report warns. Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses, the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers \"remained undiminished.\"      \"Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated,\" it says. \"Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan, along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking, have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities.\"      Iran is also a source of training to the Taliban \"on small-unit tactics, small arms, explosives and indirect-fire weapons,\" the report says.      \"Since at least 2006, Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members,\" it says.      While terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year, \"there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country, including a decrease in civilian casualties, enemy attacks, and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year,\" the report says.      There were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008, down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007, Travers said. He added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009, although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in April.      Although the threat from al Qaeda in Iraq \"continued to diminish\" due to significant defections and a loss of both territory and funding, al Qaeda continued to benefit from safe haven in Somalia and has strengthened its North African operations, the report says.      It notes a sharp increase in attacks by al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa. In Algeria, many of the attacks were blamed on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, whose tactics \"appeared to be influenced by [al Qaeda's] experience in Iraq.\"      The report also warns \"the security situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate during 2008 and was marked by a series of attacks against both Western and Yemeni interests,\" culminating in the September 17 suicide bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa that killed 18.      \"Recruitment for al Qaeda in Yemen (AQY) remained strong, and the use of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) and suicide vests indicated a high level of training, coordination, and sophistication by Yemen's terrorist leadership,\" the report says.      The report calls the government's response to the terrorist threat \"intermittent and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected terrorists remained weak due to a number of shortcomings, including stalled draft counterterrorism legislation.\"      Although a raid in August on an al Qaeda in Yemen cell in the country uncovered large number of weapons, the report warns the action \"did little to deter or disrupt other AQY cells.\"      It was a month later that at least seven assailants dressed in Yemeni security-service uniforms attacked the U.S. Embassy with explosives and suicide vests, launching what the report calls a \"sophisticated and well-coordinated\" attack.      The report says Iran \"remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism,\" including supporting terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, all of which opposed the Middle East peace process, as well as Iraq-based militants and the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.      It cites the Qods Force, an elite branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as the regime's \"primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad.\"      \"Iran's involvement in the planning and financial support of terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia had a direct impact on international efforts to promote peace, threatened economic stability in the Gulf, and undermined the growth of democracy,\" the report says.      Schlicher also said that the United States is \"troubled by indications that the Iranians may be seeking to extend their influence into other parts of the world and expand its military ties into Latin America.\"      The Obama administration has adopted a policy of engagement with Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/99a567b3bf9f177971dd95600ea1effa60f0bcb7.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What have exit polls indicated?", "id": "108161", "answers": [{"text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel defeated her foreign minister", "answer_start": 25}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel defeated her foreign minister Sunday to win another four-year term, according to exit polls reported by German television network NTV.    German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her husband, Joachim Sauer, vote Sunday in Berlin.    NTV reported Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party received 33.7 percent of the vote, based on exit poll projections.    The polls show Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier's center-left Social Democrats received 23.4 percent, the network reported.    \"Not only are you happy, I am very happy as well,\" Merkel told cheering supporters at her headquarters. \"We've accomplished something great. We've done it. We've reached our election goal, to retain a stable majority in Germany and a new government with a new coalition.\"    The crowd chanted, \"Angie, Angie, Angie.\"    Steinmeier, meanwhile, conceded what he called \"a bitter defeat\" for the Social Democrats.    \"The voters have decided, and the result is a bad day,\" Steinmeier said in a speech to supporters.    He thanked those who helped lead his campaign and those who supported him.    The two parties currently are in a coalition, with Steinmeier as foreign minister.    Few doubted that Merkel's party would receive the most votes. The question was what kind of coalition will be formed -- another broad centrist one, across the political divide, or a more right-leaning one.    Merkel favors cutting taxes to spur growth, while Steinmeier opposes tax breaks. The country is deep in debt.  What's at stake in the German election \u00bb    Voters chose members of the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, who will pick the head of government.    Each German had two votes -- one for a member of parliament representing a district and another for a political party.    The election Sunday followed release of a threatening videos from al Qaeda and the Taliban warning Germans not to vote for leaders who want to keep the country's troops in Afghanistan.    Security was tightened at airports and train stations, and authorities on Saturday banned all flights over the Oktoberfest beer festival until it ends on October 4.

An endangered blue whale surfaces off the coast of Southern California in July.    At issue in the 5-4 ruling was whether the Navy's need to conduct exercises to protect the country from enemy submarines outweighed concerns raised by environmental groups.    The case focused on whether the president had the power to issue executive waivers allowing such tests and whether federal judges can issue preliminary injunctions blocking them. The high court ultimately sided with claims of national security over environmental concerns.    Those environmental interests, said Chief Justice John Roberts for the majority, \"are plainly outweighed by the Navy's need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines.\"    Roberts said a lower federal court \"abused its discretion\" by imposing a 2,200-yard perimeter for testing and ordering a shutdown of sonar use during surfacing exercises.    But in dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned that the ecological damage was significant.    \"This likely harm cannot be lightly dismissed,\" she said, \"even in the face of an alleged risk to the effectiveness of the Navy's 14 training exercises.\"    Justices David Souter, Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens also questioned the Navy's arguments.    The exercises have continued while the case was under appeal.    Environmentalists had sued the Pentagon over the practice, and a federal judge ordered major changes to the Navy's annual offshore training exercises in March.    President Bush had issued an emergency waiver to allow the exercises to go on without the filing of an environmental impact study, but the lower court ruling blocked the use of sonar. That federal judge, in ruling against the government last March, said it was \"constitutionally suspect\" for Bush to issue the national security exemption to allow skipping the impact study.    Military officials argued that the restrictions could hamper readiness in time of war, because new sonar technology is needed to detect increasingly sophisticated enemy submarines.    \"This case was vital to our Navy and nation's security, and we are pleased with the Supreme Court's decision in this matter,\" Navy Secretary Donald Winter said. \"We can now continue to train our sailors effectively, under realistic combat conditions.\"    One of the environmental organizations that sued the Defense Department told the justices that the exercises had been planned in advance and that the Navy was required under law to conduct more extensive environmental tests than it had.    The waters of southern California are home to dozens of species of whales, dolphins, seals and sea lions, nine of them federally listed as endangered or threatened. Federal courts have cited scientific studies and the Navy's own conclusions that high levels of sonar can cause hearing loss and disorientation in the animals.    In February, the U.S. Navy demonstrated for CNN its onboard procedures for turning down mid-frequency sonar when whales come within 1,000 meters and shutting it off completely when they approach 200 meters.    The sonar sounds like a \"ping, ping\" noise, and it can be reduced as necessary, officers said.    But environmentalists say that the sonar can hurt whales much farther than 1,000 meters away and that the noise created by the sonar \"was like having a jet engine in the Supreme Court multiplied 2,000 times, compensating for water,\" attorney Richard Kendall told the justices.    Reacting to the ruling, Kendall said, \"It is gratifying that the court did not accept the Navy's expansive claims of executive power and that two-thirds of the injunction remain in place.\"    In 2000, 16 whales beached themselves in the Bahamas, and the Navy concluded that too many sonar ships had been operating in a narrow underwater channel.    The service says it is funding $16 million in independent research to minimize sonar's effect on marine mammals."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/62ac534bf7e3e897b2726dddf2b7b6f7723362d4.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who used some of Obama's words?", "id": "108166", "answers": [{"text": "Hillary Clinton", "answer_start": 15}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama each accused the other of borrowing portions of their presidential campaign speeches Monday.    Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, left,  on the stump with Sen. Barack Obama.    The Clinton campaign accused Obama of borrowing from a close supporter, and the Illinois senator responded by saying his own words have been used by Clinton.    On a conference call with reporters, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said it was clear Obama had \"lifted rhetoric\" from Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.    Late Monday, Clinton followed up with a swipe of her own.    \"If your whole candidacy is about words, then they should be your own words,\" Clinton said in Madison, Wisconsin. \"That's what I think.\"    Obama downplayed the significance of the accusation.    \"I've written two books, wrote most of my speeches. So I think putting aside the question ... in terms of whether my words are my own, I think that would be carrying it too far,\" Obama said.    \"Deval and I do trade ideas all the time, and you know he's occasionally used lines of mine,\" Obama said.    Obama said he also used some of Deval's words at a Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Wisconsin.    \"I would add I've noticed on occasion Sen. Clinton has used words of mine as well,\" said Obama. \"As I said before, I really don't think this is too big of a deal.\"    Obama campaign officials said Clinton had a pattern of borrowing from some of her rival's signature phrases, including \"Yes, We Can\" and \"Fired Up, Ready to Go.\" They circulated a YouTube video and list of these alleged instances to reporters.    The Clinton campaign earlier pointed to similarities between the words of Obama and Patrick that have raised eyebrows and attracted traffic on YouTube.    A central passage in a speech Obama gave Saturday -- aimed at convincing voters that his campaign is not just about lofty rhetoric -- is adapted from one that Patrick used in his 2006 campaign, the Obama campaign said when asked about it.    The controversy is lost on the Massachusetts governor, who endorsed Obama.    Obama's campaign had Patrick call the New York Times over the weekend and issue a statement.    \"Senator Obama and I are long-time friends and allies. We often share ideas about politics, policy and language,\" Patrick said in the statement. \"The argument in question, on the value of words in the public square, is one about which he and I have spoken frequently before. Given the recent attacks from Senator Clinton, I applaud him responding in just the way he did.\"  Watch a comparison of Obama's and Patrick's speeches \u00bb    The Obama campaign also confirmed comments chief strategist David Axelrod -- an adviser on Obama's Senate campaign and Patrick's gubernatorial run -- made to the New York Times about the speeches.    \"They often riff off one another. They share a world view,\" Axelrod told the Times about Obama and Patrick. \"Both of them are effective speakers whose words tend to get requoted and arguments tend to be embraced widely.\"    Responding to attacks from Clinton that he offers words while she offers action, Obama has been arguing that words matter.    Saturday night at a gala for the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Obama said to frequent applause, \"Don't tell me words don't matter! 'I have a dream.' Just words. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.' Just words. 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself.' Just words, just speeches!\"    In 2006, Patrick, fending off attacks from his rival Kerry Healey, told a crowd, \"Her dismissive point, and I hear it a lot from her staff, is all I have to offer is words. Just words. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal' -- just words. Just words. 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself' -- just words. 'Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country' -- just words. 'I have a dream' -- just words.\"    Clinton has argued that while Obama provides rousing speeches, she has the stronger grasp of the issues and the knowledge of how to use the presidency to start making changes from \"day one.\"    Speaking last week at a General Motors plant in Ohio, she said, \"There's a big difference between us -- speeches versus solutions, talk versus action. You know, some people may think words are change. But you and I know better. Words are cheap. I know it takes work.\" E-mail to a friend    CNN's Josh Levs, Rebecca Sinderbrand and Chris Welch contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/5020b6f34983b2805e30225104e932346b041bdd.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What kinds of plants should be kept away from pets?", "id": "108167", "answers": [{"text": "exotic", "answer_start": 1272}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Our dog Tilly loves the holiday season. Turkey for Thanksgiving. Brisket for Hanukkah. Ham for Christmas and pot roast for New Year's. With so much food moving around the house and visitors who generously -- and covertly -- feed her under the table, Tilly has always been a happy dog during the season of giving.    Two reluctant reindeer: Tilly, left, and Riley.    Not anymore.    After we spent much of one holiday season at the animal emergency center trying to keep Tilly alive, our holiday celebration turned into a hunt for household toxics.    Tilly was diagnosed with severe anemia, which could have been caused by any one of numerous toxic items found in the refrigerators, cupboards and medicine cabinets of most homes.    Now, Tilly's kibble and treats practically need their own passport to reach her mouth; human food is out of reach; visitors are asked to put away any medications and shown where the \"approved\" treats are kept.    It may sound extreme, but veterinary medical experts say this type of preventative behavior can keep pets safe. This is especially true during the holidays, when family chaos increases and your pet's environment may change from day to day with the arrival of family and friends bearing gifts, holiday food items and exotic plants.    \"Dogs and cats do not know what is bad for them,\" said Dr. Cynthia Gaskill, associate professor and veterinary clinical toxicologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. \"If there is medicine on the bathroom counter or food left on the table, that is irresistible to them.\"    And unless your houseguests are conscientious pet owners themselves, chances are they aren't aware that they may be creating a toxic environment for your pet. Gaskill says it is important to let guests know not to leave their medications in an open suitcase or otherwise exposed.    Over-the-counter and prescription medications can kill small animals.    Because metabolic systems vary between species, a drug that may alleviate pain in humans can easily induce a toxic reaction in a dog or cat. For example, ibuprofen ingested by a dog can cause gastrointestinal damage and kidney dysfunction. Cats are especially susceptible to even small amounts of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol); ingestion of just one tablet can result in anemia and potential liver damage.    Dr. Robin Van Metre, a veterinarian at the Fort Collins Veterinary Emergency Hospital in Colorado, says that many of the emergency calls he receives involve pets that have accidentally ingested prescription medications or been given an over-the-counter medication by well-meaning owners who believe that their animal is in pain. Van Metre says these calls increase significantly over the holidays.    \"Dogs will eat almost anything,\" Van Metre said, \"and there is no such thing as a dog-proof cap.\"    Take care in the kitchen, too. Typical holiday staples such as grapes and raisins have been shown to cause renal failure when ingested by dogs.    Although small amounts of onions and garlic are often used in pet foods and treats to add flavor, ingestion of large amounts can cause severe red blood cell damage; cats are especially sensitive.    Macadamia nuts can cause a short-term hind-limb paralysis, and bread dough, if eaten before baking, can expand rapidly once ingested and cause ethanol poisoning.    Sweets, gum and hard candies are often problematic depending on ingredients. Chocolate contains a theobromine, a chemical that can affect the heart, kidneys and central nervous system. Dark chocolate and baker's chocolate contain higher concentrations of theobromine and are more toxic than similar amounts of milk chocolate.    Sugar-free gums and candies that contain the sugar-substitute xylitol can lead to quick onset of toxic clinical signs that may include a rapid decrease in blood sugar and possible seizures.    Think carefully before placing mistletoe or holly in low-lying areas, but put poinsettias anywhere you like. The effects of the poinsettia, long believed poisonous, are generally benign, says Dr. Anthony Knight, author of A Guide to Poisonous House and Garden Plants and professor of clinical sciences and toxicology at Colorado State University School of Veterinary Medicine and Biological Sciences.    Exposed plant bulbs such as Amaryllis and all species of lilies should be placed out of reach of pets not only during the holidays but year-round, Knight says.    Lily toxicity in cats can reach critical levels almost immediately after ingestion and lead to acute kidney failure within 48 hours or less.    \"Lilies are one of the most poisonous houseplants that exists,\" Knight said. \"It's not just the flower but also the leaves. ... If a cat eats any part of the plant, it would need to be treated immediately.\"    What should you do if your pet ingests a toxic holiday treat?    \"Do not wait,\" Van Metre said. \"Most people wait too long to call us, and that reduces our options for treatment.\"    Van Metre recommends calling a local veterinarian or animal emergency hospital first, or the ASPCA national animal poison control center (888-426-4435). The ASPCA charges a $60 veterinary consultation fee, but information about toxins is free on the ASPCA Web site.    Gaskill does not advise calling human poison control centers or attempting to diagnose your pet on the Internet.    Human poison control \"is often not aware of the species differences and could inadvertently give the wrong advice,\" Gaskill said. \"When doing a general Internet search, make sure the site is backed by a recognized veterinary organization or veterinary medical school. If it is not referenced, it is just someone's opinion.\"    Van Metre and Gaskill both warn against inducing vomiting in your pet before speaking with a veterinarian. Getting appropriate background information about the animal is critical to preparing a treatment plan for a particular toxin, they say, and every case -- every animal -- is different.    Tilly never recovered from her anemia, but she has been in remission long enough to create another toxic scare.    After learning that Tilly had ingested an entire bag of Hershey's kisses, we called our local animal emergency hospital in Atlanta. They did a quick calculation using Tilly's weight to determine whether a one-pound bag of milk chocolate would reach toxic levels in a dog of her size. It would not, but we were forced to clean up the silver-streaked evidence for many days afterwards.    Melissa Tarkington is a former journalist for MSNBC, CNN.com and The Moscow Times.

Bobby Jindal is set to deliver the Republican response to President Obama's upcoming joint address to Congress, a high-profile slot the party often gives to one of its rising stars.    Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, 37, will give GOP response to President Obama's address to Congress this month.    \"Gov. Jindal embodies what I have long said: The Republican Party must not be simply the party of 'opposition,' but the party of better solutions,\" House Minority Leader John Boehner said in a Wednesday statement.    Jindal, a former congressman in his first term as Louisiana's governor, was widely believed to be on Republican presidential nominee John McCain's short list for vice president, and he often served as a campaign surrogate on the Arizona senator's behalf.    The 37-year-old son of Indian immigrants also was given a prime-time speaking slot at the GOP convention last September, though he ultimately decided not to attend the four-day event as Hurricane Gustav headed for landfall in his state.    An Ivy League grad and Rhodes Scholar, and his state's first nonwhite governor, Jindal has long been on the GOP's radar screen as a potential future leader and likely presidential candidate. And as the GOP is launching full-scale efforts to appeal to nonwhite voters, Jindal has become one of the party's most high-profile minorities.    \"His stewardship of the state of Louisiana, dedication to reforming government and commitment to bringing forth new and innovative ideas make him a leader not just within the Republican Party, but in our nation as a whole,\" Boehner also said of Jindal on Wednesday.    Jindal, who became governor two years after Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana, has drawn praise for spearheading the ongoing recovery efforts.    \"When you look at major statewide offices Republicans have won over the past three years, there is one, Louisiana,\" said Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor and Republican strategist. \"In a state where we lost confidence in government, perhaps more than any other state, he restored it and cut taxes.\"    Though he is often mentioned as a likely contender for the 2012 Republican presidential race, Jindal has said his current focus is on winning reelection in 2011.    Jindal also said late last year that even if he were considering running for president, now is the time to support the sitting president.    \"It doesn't matter whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent, it doesn't matter whether you voted for him or not, President-elect Barack Obama is our president,\" he said.

Gary Lawson, one of New Zealand's most successful bowlers with a joint-record 10 national titles, has been suspended for six months and fined $NZ5,000 ($3,500) following an incident at a tournament last year.      It means he is likely to miss out on selection for this year's Commonwealth Games in India.      The New Zealand fours team, of which Lawson was the leader, was accused by Canada of deliberately losing a match against Thailand at the Asia Pacific Championships in Kuala Lumpur last August.      New Zealand were defeated 17-15, having already qualified for post-section play, and Canada alleged the Kiwis lost on purpose to earn a more favorable quarterfinal draw.      The subsequent investigation has caused a furore in a genteel sport most often seen as a recreational pursuit for retirees.      Lawson's teammates Jamie Hill, Shayne Sincock and Shannon McIlroy were fined $NZ1,000 each ($700) but avoided a suspension.      A Bowls NZ judicial committee laid the blame at the 43-year-old Lawson's feet.      \"He was the skip and was literally and figuratively calling the shots. We are satisfied that the idea to lose the 17th end would have come from him,\" it said in a statement on Wednesday.      \"From what evidence we have, it is our opinion that once the Canadian complaint was referred to it, Bowls NZ not only proceeded with due expedition with the only course available to it but also was at pains through its counsel to provide all other requirements in a timely manner.      \"The delays that occurred subsequently were to a very large degree brought about in an effort to make sure that the respondents, at each stage of the proceedings, were not denied natural justice.\"      Lawson, who won two world titles on home soil in 2009, last month blamed Bowls NZ chief executive Kerry Clark for blowing the incident out of proportion.      \"The Canadians needed to beat Thailand otherwise they were going to miss out on the quarters. When it didn't happen, they put a protest in. But it was always an informal protest and they didn't want it to go further,\" he told Radio Sport.      \"Kerry Clark turned up the next day, and he's the guy who pushed it -- he pushed it at World Bowls level with coach Dave Edwards, and at the end of the day it got blown way out of proportion.      \"This is about Kerry Clark himself -- he doesn't like me and I think he hasn't done a very good job. It's just a shame he's used this to have a crack at me.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/92dec9732f4244771770150d82cd6086f40e5621.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what help is needed?", "id": "108177", "answers": [{"text": "send more troops to the volatile southern province of Kandahar,", "answer_start": 309}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BUCHAREST, Romania (CNN) -- France has agreed to send a battalion of troops to eastern Afghanistan, a NATO spokesman has said.    Canadian NATO-led soldiers walk patrol near Kandahar, Afghanistan.    James Appathurai told reporters at a briefing that the move will help NATO meet Canada's requirement that it send more troops to the volatile southern province of Kandahar, where Canadian troops are based.    Canada agreed this month to extend its commitment of about 2,500 troops until 2011 so long as NATO contributes more troops to Kandahar.    There is a \"clear unity in the alliance\" that the mission in Afghanistan must succeed, Appathurai said.    Though 25 NATO allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces, the bulk of the recent fighting has been done by U.S., Canadian, British and Dutch troops.    Appathurai also said Thursday that he did not expect NATO applicants Georgia and Ukraine to be put on a membership action plan this summit but, he said, the general sense in terms of membership for the two countries is not \"whether, but when.\"    Further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume Thursday, he said.    U.S. President George W. Bush has pushed for the admission of Ukraine and Georgia to the military alliance.    However, Russia -- which is not a NATO member -- has expressed concerns about the former Soviet republics joining NATO, which has already made members of other former Soviet countries Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.    Appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on Macedonia's bid, because of Greece's objections.    Greece has threatened to veto Macedonia's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name. Athens has long argued that the name Macedonia implies territorial claims on its northern province of the same name -- the birthplace, also, of Greece's most revered ancient warrior, Alexander the Great.    The name issue must be resolved by the two countries, Appathurai said.

But recent studies suggest that hands-free devices are just as dangerous on the road.  Studies suggest that talking on a hands-free cell phone while driving is just as dangerous as a handheld one.  Engaging in a phone conversation on a mobile device while driving distracts the brain and delays reaction times, experts said. Drivers are more likely to swerve between lanes, slow down and miss important signs.  \"When you're on a call, even if both hands are on the wheel, your head is in the call,\" said Janet Froetscher, president of the National Safety Council, which in January urged legislators in all 50 states to pass laws prohibiting motorists from using cell phone devices.  A recent University of Utah study found that drivers engaging in a cell phone conversation on a headset were more likely to make errors behind the wheel than a driver talking to a front-seat passenger.  \"It doesn't matter what kind of cell phone device they are using, because the impairments are so large,\" said University of Utah professor David Strayer, who used a high-tech driving simulator for his experiment.  Strayer's study, published in December, concluded that conversations with a front-seat passenger can actually mitigate accidents, because the passenger can help observe road conditions and warn the driver of possible hazards.  In Strayer's previous studies, he found driving while talking on a mobile device is \"just as bad as driving drunk.\"  The risk of getting into a car accident while talking on a wireless device -- including headsets and vehicles with built-in communication systems -- is growing as the number of cell phone subscribers increases.  There are 270 million cell phone subscribers in the United States, up from 76 million in 1999, according to CTIA -- The Wireless Association, an organization representing the wireless communications industry.  In a survey by Nationwide Insurance, 80 percent of people admitted to talking on their cell phones while driving. About 45 percent of drivers said they have been hit or nearly hit by someone using a cell phone, according to Nationwide's survey, conducted in 2006.  Some experts said drivers talking on cell phones are four times more likely to get into a crash than those who don't talk on their phones behind the wheel.  One study from the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis estimated that 636,000 traffic accidents each year -- about 6 percent of all accidents -- are caused by drivers using their cell phones, resulting in an estimated 2,600 deaths.  Elderly and younger drivers are most at risk of getting into an accident when they talk on a mobile device while driving, said Arthur Kramer, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  \"I don't think legislation alone is the answer,\" Kramer said. \"Education needs to go along with the legislation to encourage people that these are risky habits for yourself and for others.\"  There is no federal law against using handheld devices on the road, but six states and the District of Columbia have such laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks legislative data trends. No states ban the use of hands-free or wireless communication devices, experts said.  Some private industries, such as trucking and bus companies, prohibit their employees from using cell phones on the road. Other states restrict teenagers from talking on cell phones while driving.  Anne Teigen, a policy specialist on transportation issues for the National Conference of State Legislatures, says states are moving to ban handheld cell phone use. Almost all states have debated the issue, but many governments are reluctant to pass restrictions because they say there isn't enough research.  They point out that talking on a mobile device isn't the only distraction. Other distractions, such as reaching for the glove compartment, changing the radio station or putting on makeup, also can cause accidents.  The popularity of smart phones equipped with Internet, text messaging and e-mail present drivers with even more distractions. Such new technology also makes it difficult for states to keep their laws updated.  \"Then there is the final question of whether these laws are enforceable or not,\" Teigen said.  Some members of the cell phone industry are advising drivers to stop using cell phones on the road, but few have taken a stance on hands-free devices, because research has been limited.  Verizon Wireless was one of the first cellular phone companies to support hands-free driving laws in the early 2000s. The company is focusing on promoting laws against text-messaging while driving. So far, only a handful of states ban the practice.  Aegis Mobility, a Vancouver, Canada, company, has created a device that would reduce cell phone usage in cars. The product, DriveAssist, set to launch this fall with a major network carrier in the United States, will enable cell phones to automatically detect when a mobile user is driving.  Users can subscribe to DriveAssist's service, which manages incoming and outgoing calls, text messages and e-mails electronically. Callers get a message that the recipient is driving but can leave an emergency message alerting the driver to pull over and return the call.  \"People find it hard to stop talking on their cell phones because we've been conditioned our entire life to answer the phone,\" said David Teater of Spring Lake, Michigan, one of the product's backers.  Five years ago, Teater's seventh-grade son died in a daytime car accident after a woman talking on her cell phone ran a red light.  \"Her life was ruined as well,\" Teater said. \"She had no idea what she was doing was so dangerous. The vast majority of drivers have no idea that it's dangerous.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/28e251ea722829df08d63e83824110fedcc13f8c.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Which fire grew to 25,000 acres?", "id": "108181", "answers": [{"text": "The Santiago", "answer_start": 294}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "ORANGE COUNTY, California (CNN) -- One of the larger fires in Southern California was deliberately started by someone with apparent knowledge of arson, a fire official said Thursday.  Firefighter Luke Perisin sets a backfire Wednesday against the Santiago Fire in Live Oak Canyon, California.  The Santiago Fire in Orange County was started in two places along a little-traveled road, according to Chief Chip Prather of the county's fire authority.  The fire, which has burned more than 25,000 acres, was started in brush just off Santiago Canyon Road, not close to homes. It spread rapidly, indicating the arsonist had some knowledge of winds and other factors.  \"It is a confirmed arson. There was evidence found at the scene. That is the purpose of our early declaration of it being an arson-caused fire,\" Prather said. He would not describe the evidence.  Watch how the evidence points to arson \u00bb  Prather said officials originally thought the fire had three points of origin instead of two.  The Santiago Fire's points of origin are considered crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  The reward for information leading to an arrest has increased to $250,000 -- $50,000 each from the governor's office, the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI, Prather said. KFI radio has chipped in another $100,000, the sheriff's department said.  The state established a toll-free arson tip line at 800-540-7085. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said anyone convicted of arson would be dealt with harshly.  If a suspect is to be found, \"it's going to be by a clue from the public,\" said county Sheriff Mike Corona.  About 1,100 firefighters were working on controlling the Santiago Fire, which has destroyed at least 22 structures, according to Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was only 30 percent contained Thursday morning after being 50 percent contained the day before.  Watch the Santiago flames rage \u00bb  The motive of the Santiago Fire's arsonist was a mystery to Concepcion.  \"That's the part that I really can't figure out, to tell you the truth,\" he told CNN. \"That individual knew on Sunday when this fire started that we had, really, the perfect storm, if you will. We had the heavy Santa Ana winds, we had the low relative humidities, we had the high temperatures.  \"And then for someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire where they knew the fire would grow as rapidly as it would -- traveling about three, 3\u00bd miles in about an hour -- is just really absolutely unconscionable,\" he said.  The smaller Rosa Fire in Riverside County, 100 percent contained at 411 acres Thursday morning, was also probably arson, state officials said.  Meanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are looking into whether a man who was arrested on suspicion of arson in the San Fernando Valley may have had a role in any of the ongoing blazes, an L.A. police spokeswoman said.  Catalino Pineda, 41, was arrested Wednesday, Officer Kate Lopez told CNN. Witnesses told police they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside in the West Hills area of San Fernando -- northwest of Los Angeles -- then walking away, Lopez said.  Pineda was already on probation for \"making excessive false emergency reports\" to police at the time of the arrest, Lopez said. His bail has been set at $75,000, she said.  The fire he allegedly set was brought under control, but now authorities want to find out if he had any role in the other wildfires.  In San Bernardino County, John Alfred Rund, 48, was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with setting a small fire along a rural roadside near Victorville.  Rund was to be arraigned Thursday morning in Victorville. He was being held in lieu of $750,000 bail.  The county's district attorney's office on Thursday also filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail and will be arraigned later Thursday.  The San Diego County Sheriff's Department also arrested an adult and a juvenile accused by an anonymous tipster of starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista Fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said.  Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley Fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 10,152-acre Slide Fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said.

Dugard, kidnapped 18 years ago in South Lake Tahoe, California, helped manage the small printing company her alleged captor, Phillip Garrido, ran from his home in Antioch, east of San Francisco.    Her two daughters, fathered by 58-year-old Garrido, attended birthday parties and, like many girls their age, shared a love for the TV show \"Hannah Montana.\"    The media \"made it seem like these little girls were living like wolves or jungle kids in the backyard dungeon.

She was a very pretty girl, a very pretty young lady.\"    The children, however, sometimes stood out.    \"They were not dressed like average teenage girls. They were dressed very conservatively,\" Karunaratne said.    Another customer, Ben Daughdrill, sometimes corresponded with Dugard when he used the printing service for his junk-hauling business.    \"Nothing stood out,\" he said. \"Obviously, there was some brainwashing going on.

They face 29 felony charges, including rape and kidnapping, and both have pleaded not guilty.    Authorities said the Garridos held Dugard and her daughters in a soundproof shed in the couple's overgrown, littered backyard.    Garrido told Karunaratne that he had a soundproof recording studio in the backyard, said Karunaratne, who described Garrido's music as \"Christian, contemporary\" and said some songs \"were about love and romance.\"  Watch aerial view of backyard compound \u00bb    Dugard and her mother and daughters have moved to an undisclosed location as they try to get reacquainted, said Carl Probyn, Dugard's stepfather. A team of psychologists and several law enforcement officers are with them, he said.    In a related development, authorities in two San Francisco Bay-area cities are investigating whether disappearances dating back to the late 1980s could be connected to Garrido.    Police in Hayward, about 20 miles south of Oakland, say they are investigating whether he is connected to the disappearance of Michaela Garecht, last seen in 1988 at age 9.    Hayward Police Lt. Chris Orrey said there are similarities between Garecht's disappearance and Dugard's -- similar age and appearance, both were abducted in daylight, and a sketch of a suspect resembles Garrido, she said.    Orrey said there were differences as well, though she would not elaborate. But she said Hayward police have been in contact with Garecht's family and witnesses since Dugard was found alive last week.    And in Dublin, about 25 miles east of Oakland, police are looking into whether Garrido was connected to the 1989 disappearance of Ilene Misheloff. Ilene was 13 when she was abducted, investigators said.    Investigators announced Saturday that they were looking into whether Garrido may have been behind other unsolved crimes.    Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Steve Simpkins said police in Antioch and neighboring Pittsburg were searching Garrido's property \"for evidence relating to open cases.\"    Authorities brought cadaver dogs to search the property next door to the Garridos as they tried to determine whether Garrido was connected to a string of unsolved slayings of prostitutes in the 1990s. Several of the women's bodies were dumped near a park where Garrido worked at the time.

We're fighting hard for it. This woman has been working tirelessly through this campaign. ... Hillary has earned the right to do whatever she wants to do.\"    Obama said he's ready for what would be the next phase if he becomes the nominee: a matchup against Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP candidate.    Obama said he was offended when McCain said last month, \"It's very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president.\"    \"I think it's disappointing because John McCain always says, 'Well, I'm not going to run that kind of politics,' and then to engage in that kind of smear I think is unfortunate, particularly since my policy on Hamas has been no different than his,\" Obama said.    \"And so for him to toss out comments like that, I think, is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination.\"    When asked to respond to McCain supporters -- such as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- who have said Obama is not ready to be commander in chief, the senator from Illinois said he thinks what people are looking for is \"good judgment.\"    \"I think I've consistently displayed the kind of judgment that the American people are looking for in the next president,\" he said.  Watch Obama say why he's qualified to be president \u00bb    Romney responded later on \"The Situation Room,\" saying \"The truth of the matter is just as I said, that he doesn't have a record of accomplishments in the private sector or in the governmental sector ...  hasn't pushed a major piece of legislation.    \"He seems like a charming guy who's very well-spoken. But in terms of actually having led, actually having accomplished something, actually having a kind of leadership that America needs at a critical time with our economy ... he's untested. ... Frankly, Sen. McCain is someone who is tested and very proven,\" he added."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/6505176e30e931b9e3d46c5202083a27c15d65e0.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who win the Pulitzer for the novel?", "id": "108199", "answers": [{"text": "Prize-winning author Chabon", "answer_start": 1854}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It was one of the greatest humanitarian acts in history.    Pondering an imaginary Yiddish-speaking place produced \"The Yiddish Policemen's Union,\" says Michael Chabon.    At the beginning of World War II, as the Nazis tightened their grip on Europe, the U.S. government allowed millions of Jews to resettle from their homes in Poland and Russia to southeastern Alaska, along the panhandle.   Two million Jews had died at the hands of the Nazi scourge, but millions more were saved as the Federal District of Sitka, Alaska, became the new Jewish homeland -- all the more important when the fledgling State of Israel went down to defeat in 1948.    However, 60 years later, Sitka is about to be returned to local jurisdiction, and the island's Jews -- including a noted detective, Meyer Landsman -- are wondering where to go next. The Jewish people, forever rootless, will have to wander some more.    Landsman's got other problems, too. He's rootless himself, biding his time in a seedy hotel. There's the body that turned up in a nearby room, a onetime chess prodigy who appears to have major connections with some big shots -- machers, in the local Yiddish lingo. There's his ex-wife, now his boss -- at least until the department is disbanded -- and his partner, a half-Jewish, half-Tlingit named Berko who's far more responsible than Landsman.    And there are a host of old enemies with long memories, particularly when Landsman decides to root around the dead chess player's case.    Landsman's world is fiction, of course, a product of Michael Chabon's imagination. Chabon's new book, \"The Yiddish Policeman's Union\" (HarperCollins), combines Landsman's hard-boiled detective's terrain with the landscape of alternate history, one in which world events take a startling turn.    The story is rooted in fact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Chabon (\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\") observes.    Chabon had written an article about the decline of Yiddish, and the reaction to the piece -- some of it very negative -- \"got me thinking about ... a possible, but nonexistent, imaginary Yiddish-speaking place in the modern world,\" he says in an interview at CNN Center.    In the article, he noted an actual plan by Franklin Roosevelt's Interior secretary, Harold Ickes, to create a refuge for European Jews in Alaska, still 20 years from statehood. In reality, the plan was squelched thanks to the opposition of Alaska delegate Anthony Dimond, but in the \"Yiddish Policemen's\" world, Dimond is conveniently killed off and the plan goes forward.    Chabon's Federal District of Sitka is a land of tall apartment blocks and grimy streets, as if \"Hong Kong had moved to the other side of the Pacific Ocean,\" he says.    The novel is peppered with clever conceits. The book's black hats, as in villains, are actual \"black hats,\" a slang term for ultra-Orthodox Jews. The characters are fond of Filipino doughnuts, a twist on the Jewish taste for Chinese food. The place names of Russian Alaska are an apt companion to the Eastern European surnames of Chabon's Jews, and then there are throwaway bits -- such as in the Sitka of 2001, Orson Welles did release a version of \"Heart of Darkness.\"    Doing a genre novel -- or several at once, as \"The Yiddish Policeman's Union\" is part detective story, part alt-history, part modern Jewish folktale -- isn't considered the natural turf for a so-called literary writer like Chabon, but the author -- who has been vocal in support of genre fiction -- makes no apologies for the work.    \"I only ever try to write in genres that I love ... I love hard-boiled detective novels, I love fantasy, I love science fiction,\" he says. \"It feels like a natural impulse to want to integrate that passion that I have as a reader into my writing. I didn't see a good reason not to. ... And to say that there's something inherently inferior about the mystery genre is just silly.\"    In writing \"The Yiddish Policeman's Union,\" Chabon says, the key was re-reading Raymond Chandler, creator of L.A. detective Philip Marlowe and a distinctive tough-guy style, as well as the Russian-Jewish short story writer Isaac Babel, \"whose use of simile and metaphor strangely echoed Chandler,\" he says.    Babel also had a \"clear-eyed view of violence. ... There's a kinship there between Chandler and Babel, and that's what helped me kind-of forge the voice for this novel,\" Chabon says.    But, he adds, \"the whole novel is itself a simile. It's setting up a series of semblances and mirrorings of the world we live in, so it seemed almost necessary, not just from a stylistic point of view but from a thematic point of view.\" Chabon's layered themes include reason's conflict with religious extremism, an idea that comes to the fore as the novel progresses.    Holding a mirror to our world is a common theme of alternate histories, and Chabon says he is fond of the type in general. The noted comic-book fan -- he co-wrote \"Spider-Man 2\" -- cites two favorites: the \"what-if\" scenarios often proposed in the Superman comics, and an issue of National Lampoon that celebrated John F. Kennedy's fifth inaugural with the cover line, \"JFK's First 6,000 Days.\"    \"I read and re-read that a dozen times,\" he says. \"It had an undertone of poignance. ... It was like a perpetual November 21, 1963. America never went through any of the turbulence of the '60s. ... It was the opposite of most counterfactual fiction, which tends to present the catastrophic -- what if the bad things happened. ... This was presenting an 'if only,' not a 'what if.' \"    Which is not to say \"The Yiddish Policeman's Union\" is presenting a better -- or worse -- future. There is a darkness in the book, Chabon observes. But there's also the idea that millions of people were saved from the death camps.    \"I'm certainly not presenting the world of this novel as 'it would have been better this way.' It's a dark world, and the Jews of Sitka are on the brink of the abyss,\" he says. \"But there is a certain 'if only' quality.\"    \"The Yiddish Policeman's Union\" has earned mostly admiring reviews. \" 'The Yiddish Policemen's Union' builds upon the achievement of 'Kavalier & Clay,' \" wrote the notoriously hard-to-please Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times.    Reaction from the public has been positive and even put him on The New York Times' hardcover bestseller list, a rarified place for any author. \"I feel like the book has been embraced,\" says Chabon.    Perhaps the only people concerned about the book's subject matter are some Jews, who have asked Chabon if the book isn't, well, \"too Jewish.\"    \"It reminds me of when my first novel, 'The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,' came out ... and everybody in Pittsburgh said, 'Are you crazy? Why would you set a novel in Pittsburgh? Who's going to want to read a novel about Pittsburgh?' \" he laughs. \"The reason we read fiction is know what it would be like to really be someone else. ...

Archaeologists found a hoard of gold coins from the 7th century in Jerusalem on Sunday.    The Israel Antiquities Authority reported a thrilling find Sunday -- the discovery of 264 ancient gold coins in Jerusalem National Park.    The coins were minted during the early 7th century.    \"This is one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever discovered in Jerusalem -- certainly the largest and most important of its period,\" said Doron Ben-Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets, who are directing the excavation on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority.    Researchers discovered the coins at the beginning of the eight-day Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which started at sunset on Sunday.    One of the customs of the holiday is to give \"gelt,\" or coins, to children, and the archaeologists are referring to the find as \"Hanukkah money.\"    Nadine Ross, a British archaeological volunteer, happened onto the coins during the dig just below the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem.    \"To be honest, I just thought, 'Thank God I didn't throw it in the rubbish bucket,' \" said Ross, who had taken four weeks off from her engineering job in England to work at the site. \"I was just glad I sort of spotted it before I disturbed it too much.\"    The 1,400-year-old coins were found in the Giv'ati car park in the City of David in the walls around Jerusalem National Park, a site that has yielded other finds, including a well-preserved gold earring with pearls and precious stones.    They were in a collapsed building that dates back to the 7th century, the end of the Byzantine period.  The coins bear a likeness of Heraclius, who was the Byzantine emperor from 610 to 641.    The authority said that while different coins had been minted during this emperor's reign, the coins found at the site represent \"one well-known type.\"    In that style, the emperor is clad with military garb and is holding a cross in his right hand. On the other side is the sign of the cross.    Authorities said the excavation of the building where the hoard was discovered is in its early stages. They are attempting to learn about the building and its owner and the circumstances of its destruction.    \"Since no pottery vessel was discovered adjacent to the hoard, we can assume that it was concealed inside a hidden niche in one of the walls of the building. It seems that with its collapse, the coins piled up there among the building debris,\" Ben-Ami and Tchekhanovets said.    The find is a a golden moment for Ross, who said \"it is a pity that I can't take it home with me.

This photo, taken by Warner Glenn in 1996, is believed to be the first of a live jaguar in the United States.    When most people think of jaguars, they think of the jungles of Central and South America, not the remote desert ranges between the United States and Mexico.    That region is known as mountain lion country, and that's what rancher Warner Glenn thought he was tracking when he saddled up his mules on a summer day 12 years ago near Douglas, Arizona.    Glenn has hunted mountain lions for 60 years, since he was eight years old. But Glenn was stunned when he saw what his hunting dogs had chased up to a high mountain perch.    The rancher took what's believed to be the first photo of a live jaguar in the United States. But it wasn't his last. In 2006, some 40 miles away, Glenn and his hunting party again cornered a jaguar -- a different one.    Jaguars, an endangered species, have a breeding population in northern Mexico. Scientists believe there are no more than 120 left in the wild there.    It's believed that since 1910, the cats are only visitors north of the border. They have been virtually unstudied here until recently.    But Glenn and other conservationists worry that the possible return of breeding jaguars to the United States could be stopped in its tracks. The reason: the border fence.    Last month the Department of Homeland Security waived 30 environmental laws to finish 470 miles of the fence by the end of the year.    Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told Congress that the agency continues to talk to some 600 landowners along the border to get their input. But in order to comply with the congressional mandate, he said, there is no time to deal with \"unnecessary delays caused by administrative processes or potential litigation.\"    \"We are currently in a lawless situation at the border,\" says Chertoff. \"I feel an urgency to get this tactical infrastructure in. And although we're going to be respectful of the environment, we're going to be expeditious.\"    Two environmental groups, Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club, have filed appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming the waivers are unconstitutional and set a dangerous precedent.    \"National security and environmental protection do not have to be at odds with each other,\" says Defenders of Wildlife spokesman Matt Clark. \"If we can drop this arbitrary deadline for constructing the fence and go through the proper procedures, then there are inevitably ways to minimize environmental impact, but as it is now it's throwing all of those laws out the window.\"    Mountain lion tracker Jack Childs also worries about the impact of the fence on local wildlife, especially the jaguar.    Childs captured the first video of a live jaguar in the late summer of 1996, a few months after Warner Glenn.  Watch Childs and Glenn talk about efforts to preserve the jaguar \u00bb    \"I knew historically there had been a few jaguars sighted in Arizona but in the last hundred years never in any numbers.\"    His encounter sparked a passion for the big cats. Along with wife Anna and biologist Emil McCain, he created the Borderlands Jaguar Detection Project.  See images of the controversy \u00bb    Childs and McCain hike into remote mountain areas where the jaguars roam and have placed more than 50 motion sensor cameras near the border. They've taken 69 photos of three different jaguars since 2001, including several of the same cat Childs first saw in 1996.    He has nicknamed that cat Macho B.    A jaguar's spots are like fingerprints -- each cat has a unique set. One of the spots on Macho B resembles a Pinocchio cartoon figure, and that's how they identify him.    \"We spend a lot of time walking along the border during the daytime, and we actually find his tracks going through the fence, so we know for sure that he crosses back and forth,\" says Childs.    \"A fence like that is going to inhibit wildlife movements and migrations back and forth. It's not going to effectively stop human traffic. They've got wire cutters and torches.\"  See where the jaguars have been spotted \u00bb    Childs says the fence also has an impact on wildlife because drug runners and human traffickers have been pushed up into the mountain areas to avoid the fence in the lowland valleys.    \"It's impacting the animals number one, what's going on down there. It's almost brought my wildlife study to a stop because they (the traffickers) are tearing down my cameras as fast as I'm putting them up because they think we're taking pictures of them.\"    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finds itself in a unique position. Its mission is wildlife and habitat protection, but it must uphold another federal agency's mission to override environmental concerns. Bill Radke, manager of the San Bernardino Wildlife Refuge, says the Border Patrol is trying to work with his agency.    \"The hope is that by working with Border Patrol that we can meet the national security mandate and at the same time protect the wildlife,\" says Radke. \"Border Patrol is putting up camera towers but are putting them up on areas that are off the refuge. They're working on barriers but not barriers that would impede wildlife and large animals like jaguars.\"    At 6 foot 6, with steely blue eyes, dressed in leather chaps astride his mule, rancher Warner Glenn is every inch the American cowboy. And he is a man forever changed by his encounters with the jaguar. He has written a book, \"Eyes of Fire,\" about his experience. He says he'd like to \"invite Mr. Bush to come out on a mule\" so he can see \"what's going on here in these mountains.\"    For Glenn, the cat represents all that is wild about the Southwest.    \"It would be a loss to me that maybe my granddaughter or my daughter wouldn't be able to see one like I have. It's just an animal that's a beautiful, magnificent cat and they're having a little bit of trouble surviving. But they're doing it, and I would hate to see us do anything that would cause the survival of that cat to go backwards.    \"I'm a livestock rancher, but I wouldn't mind donating a few calves to that jaguar, so to speak.\"    Biologist Emil McCain agrees.    \"They are part of our natural heritage. They are part of the American West. They are part of the American wild as much as the bald eagle or the grizzly bear, and the jaguar is really special because it is such an elusive and beautiful creature [that] it evokes a sense of imagination and curiosity about the natural world.\"    Though the jaguar is elusive, conservationists say the animal is caught -- in the political crossfire at the border.

More than 300 people -- many of them young Australians on vacation -- were wounded by the massive blasts in the town of Kuta. Dozens of victims were burned beyond recognition or blown to pieces.

Naples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash.  There is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this: everybody is competent enough (to find a solution) but nobody is responsible (for actually carrying it out).  In many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business. Garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit. In Naples, garbage is also good business, but in the sense that millions, if not billions, of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how.  The problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash. The region's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago, and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year. Eight different commissioners have been appointed, but they have all failed to solve the problem. State of emergency means government money: \u20ac1.8 billion (more than $2.5 billion) in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem.  It is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent. Incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished, either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job, or else because magistrates stopped the work, pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement.  One Italian newspaper suggested that a good 20% of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem.  More worrying perhaps, is another suggestion: that the local mafia, known as the Camorra, is taking advantage of the situation. As the crisis has worsened over the years, so the Camorra's profits, estimated now at around \u20ac1 billion (roughly $1.45 billion), are alleged to have increased.  How does the local mafia make money? The Naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation.  Once they receive the money, companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or, ironically, at regular city dumps, even if they are overflowing. The mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile.  But why are citizens protesting now? Well, the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Naples and surrounding areas. The problem is that when the site was closed years ago, locals were promised that a golf course would be built there. As a result, many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site.  They are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes. A rotten deal indeed.

Some Christians have faith that is indeed the case.  It was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Texas, the southernmost state in the I-35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called \"Light the Highway.\"  Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35, but the prayers are still continuing.  Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35 being the \"holy\" highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the the interstate's shoulder in Dallas.  They chanted loudly and vibrantly, making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would \"see the light\" and perhaps close down.  They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate. They prayed that all Americans would accept Jesus into their lives.  Watch believers offer prayers \u00bb  The woman who came up with the concept of \"Light the Highway\" is a Texas minister named Cindy Jacobs.  She says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after \"once again reading Isaiah, Chapter 35.\"  Jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history, such as the bridge collapse on I-35 in Minneapolis last August and the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I-35 in Dallas. That's why prayer certainly can't hurt, she adds.  Now, it's only fair to say most people, the religious and the non-religious alike, don't buy any of this, but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I-35.  At an adult go-go club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others. And he says his club holds fundraisers, food drives and toy drives to help the community.  But on the side of the road, the prayerful aren't going to change their minds. Holy highways and nude clubs, they believe, are not a combination God has in mind.

Kathleen Sebelius says health care costs are a huge and growing burden on the economy.    (CNN) -- Today in Washington, some politicians like to suggest that the many challenges we face as a nation mean we shouldn't tackle health care reform.    Nothing could be further from the truth.    With more and more of America's families, businesses, and local, state and federal governments struggling with the crushing costs of health care, health care reform has never been more important.    As President Obama has often said, you can't fix the economy without fixing health care. Unless we fix what is broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. Health care reform is not a luxury. It is a necessity.    It's important to look at the size of the problem we face and where we stand. Today, we have by far the most expensive health system in the world. We spend 50 percent more per person on health care than the average developed country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We spend more on health care than housing or food, the McKinsey Global Institute reported.    Nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured, millions more are underinsured, and they aren't the only ones who are suffering. The high cost of care is hurting all of us. A recent study by Families USA estimates that insured families pay a hidden health tax of more than $1,000 every year. The hidden tax is the amount businesses and families with insurance have to pay in insurance premiums, taxes and donations to help cover the cost of treating uninsured Americans.    Health insurance premiums for families that are covered through a job at a small business have increased 85 percent since 2000, and more small businesses are thinking about dropping health insurance benefits.    Nationwide, health care costs consume 18 percent of our gross domestic product. If we continue on our current path, health care costs will consume 34 percent of our GDP by 2040, and the number of uninsured Americans will rise to 72 million, according to the Council of Economic Advisers.    Even though we spend more than any other nation on health care, we aren't healthier. Only three developed countries have higher infant mortality rates. Our nation ranks 24th in life expectancy among developed countries. More than one-third of Americans are obese.    These statistics are the signs of a system that is both unacceptable and unsustainable. They also show us the high cost of doing nothing. If we choose the status quo, more Americans will be uninsured, costs will continue to rise, and every American's health care will be at risk.    Inaction is not an option, and reform is long overdue. The Obama administration is working to enact reform that will reduce costs for families, businesses and government; protect people's choice of doctors, hospitals and health plans; and assure affordable, quality health care for all Americans. We are guided by a simple principle: Protect what works about health care and fix what's broken, and do it in a way that does not add to the deficit.    The president has already introduced proposals that will provide $950 billion over 10 years in savings to finance health care reform. Much of these resources come from wringing waste out of the current system and aggressively prosecuting fraud and abuse.    We will continue to work with Congress as it explores other financing options, and the president is open to ideas about how we finance health care reform. But we are not open to deficit spending. Health care reform will be paid for, and it will be deficit-neutral over 10 years.    Working together, we can pass real health care reform that gives Americans the choices they deserve and the affordable, quality coverage they need. And we know they do not want us to wait. Too many people have suffered without basic medical care or paid too much for it.    For years, the American people have called on Washington to meet this challenge. They have waited long enough. The time for reform is now.    The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Sebelius."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/e337f93e6d93f51fc69a5973e6ff614dd9ce6438.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Explain why was Marie Curie urged not to collect her second prize", "id": "108219", "answers": [{"text": "marred by scandal.", "answer_start": 5582}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(Mental Floss) -- It's Nobel Prize announcement week, and if you had Carol W. Greider, Elizabeth Blackburn, or Jack Szostak in your office pool, you're off to a good start (the trio will share this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine). As we await news of the rest of the winners, here are some stories about past Nobel laureates.    Nobel Prize winners receive a medal and a cash award.    1. Robert Lucas, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on the theory of \"rational expectations,\" split his $1 million prize with his ex-wife.    If there were a Nobel Prize for Foresight or Timing, she should be nominated, based on a clause in their divorce settlement from seven years earlier: \"Wife shall receive 50 percent of any Nobel Prize.\" The clause expired on October 31, 1995. Had Lucas won any year after, he would have kept the whole million.    2. Physicist Lise Meitner, whose work helped lead to the discovery of nuclear fission, was reportedly nominated for the Nobel Prize 13 times without ever winning (though nominations are kept secret, so we don't know for sure). This makes her the Dynasty of the Nobel Prize scene -- that show was nominated for 24 Emmy Awards but never won. Other analogies we'd accept: The Color Purple (11 Oscar nominations in 1985, no wins), the Buffalo Bills or Minnesota Vikings (4 Super Bowl losses each without a victory) and William Jennings Bryan (three-time Democratic nominee for President, losing twice to McKinley and once to Taft.)    3. People who refused the prize:    \u2022 Le Duc Tho was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize with Henry Kissinger for their roles in brokering a Vietnam cease fire at the Paris Peace Accords. Citing the absence of actual peace in Vietnam, Tho declined to accept.    \u2022 Jean Paul Sartre waved off the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature. His explanation: \"It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize winner. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\"    \u2022 Afraid of Soviet retribution if he traveled to Stockholm to claim his prize, Boris Pasternak declined to accept the 1958 Prize in Literature, which he'd earned for Doctor Zhivago. The Academy refused his refusal. \"This refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award. There remains only for the Academy, however, to announce with regret that the presentation of the Prize cannot take place.\" Yevgeny Pasternak accepted the prize on behalf of his deceased father in 1989.    \u2022 Swedish poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt won for Literature in 1918. He did not accept because he was Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize. He was given the award posthumously in 1931. This was allowed because the nomination was made before Karlfeldt died -- no candidate may be proposed after death. Mental Floss: 10 technologies we stole from the animal kingdom    4. In 2007, 90-year-old professor Leonid Hurwicz became the oldest person to ever win (one-third of the Prize in Economics); at 87, writer Doris Lessing became the oldest woman (Literature).    5. DNA expert Kary Mullis -- 1993 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry -- was scheduled to be a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's murder trial. However, Simpson's lawyer Barry Scheck felt the prosecution's DNA case was already essentially destroyed, and he didn't want Mullis' personal life to distract jurors (he'd expressed an affinity for LSD.)    6. Nobel Laureates you must know: Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Teresa, Elie Wiesel, Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, Jimmy Carter, Toni Morrison, William Faulkner, T.S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, Pierre & Marie Curie, Max Planck and Albert Einstein.    7. Big names who never won: Dmitri Mendeleev, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Mark Twain, Gertrude Stein, Henrik Ibsen, Joan Robinson, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Jules-Henri Poincar\u00e9, Raymond Damadian and Mahatma Gandhi. Mental Floss: 6 people who accidentally found a fortune    8. Winners without the greatest reputations:    \u2022 Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, who won in 1976 for his research in human slow-virus infections, spent 19 months in jail after pleading guilty in 1997 to charges of child molestation.    \u2022 Johannes Fibiger won in 1926 after discovering parasitic worms cause cancer -- a breakthrough that turned out to not be true.    \u2022 Yasser Arafat shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize with Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. This decision caused Nobel Committee member Kare Kristiansen to resign. \"What consequences will result,\" he asked at the time, \"when a terrorist with such a background is awarded the world's most prestigious prize?\"    \u2022 William Shockley won for Physics in 1956 for his role in the invention of the semiconductor, but his support of the eugenics movement alienated the scientific community. Shockley also donated sperm to the Repository for Germinal Choice, a sperm bank developed to spread humanity's best genes.    9. As part of his divorce settlement, Einstein's Nobel Prize money went to his ex-wife, Mileva Maric.    10. The Curie family is a Nobel Prize machine, winning five: Pierre and Marie for Physics in 1901; Marie solo for Chemistry in 1911; daughter Irene and her husband Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie for Chemistry in 1935; and Henry Labouisse, who was married to Pierre and Marie's daughter Eve, accepted on behalf of UNICEF in 1965.    11. Marie Curie's second prize was marred by scandal. Then a widow, Curie had an affair with a married scientist, Paul Langevin -- a former pupil of Pierre Curie. Love letters were involved, eventually leading to a duel between Langevin and the editor of the newspaper that had printed them (no shots were actually fired.)    According to NobelPrize.org, when it was suggested that Curie not accept the prize, she wrote a shrewd letter, \"which pointed out that she had been awarded the Prize for her discovery of radium and polonium, and that she could not accept the principle that appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by slander concerning a researcher's private life.\"    12. Singing support --While there's no evidence the Nobel judges can be swayed by theme songs, that hasn't stopped Loriana Lana from composing one for Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. \"Peace Can\" includes the lyrics, \"Silvio forever will be / Silvio is reality / Silvio forever! /Silvio gives us trust.\"    13. Alfred Nobel -- inventor of dynamite -- may have been inspired to create the Nobel Prize after a premature obituary in a French newspaper called him a \"merchant of death.\"    14. Nobel died on December 10, 1896. The formal awards ceremony is held in Stockholm each year on the anniversary of his death. The first awards show took place on December 10, 1901. (These things take time to plan.)    And in case you were wondering just how much of a say Alfred Nobel had in the prize, here's what he wrote in his will:    \"The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way:    \"The capital shall be invested by my executors in safe securities and shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.    \"The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical works by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, so that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be Scandinavian or not.\"  Mental Floss: 13 bizarre stipulations in wills    For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9b442e55b71c11c6bade08da38b36c721b841dbd.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what is the competition for", "id": "108224", "answers": [{"text": "battlefield.", "answer_start": 2408}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- He is perhaps the most recognizable man in fashion, almost never seen without his dark glasses, a silver ponytail and fingerless gloves.    And while the German-born fashion designer has been the creative force behind fashion house Chanel for more than a quarter of a century, he's still thriving on new ideas, designs and what the future may hold.    \"I don't look back... Life is not something made by order, we have to fit in the pattern of what life is all about now, and I'm a person who fits easily into this kind of situation because I like change,\" he told CNN in Shanghai.    While his own image is enduring, he is the creative force of  the Chanel fashion house, whose eponymous designer, Coco Chanel created some of the most iconic outfits of the 20th century.    He may have upset the traditionalists when he first took over the reins, but for the forward-thinking Lagerfeld, it was not a concern.    \"My job is to put in people's brain the idea what Chanel was all about, even if it was not about such a large choice of things... I pushed [Coco Chanel's] symbol, like the change of pearls, in a way much more than she did herself. I could play with everything and mix it with everything that's going on in fashion because fashion is about that. It's not retrospective, it has to be something you want to wear now,\" he said.    As for the notoriously harsh world of fashion, Lagerfeld sees it merely as a reflection of the way the world works.    \"This is a world with no pity or that you can complain, 'I couldn't do it because things are against me.' No, things are against nobody, if you have something to offer, or if you can be something,\" he said.    \"If you want to be successful in the fashion world, as well as the movie world and music world, it's something else that you need, but you cannot decide that you have it. It's up to you to sew it, but it's up to the others to use it. In a way it's the worst of worlds, but if you made in the world, it's beyond pleasant.\"    Confident and unabashed Lagerfeld is looking forward to more creative inspiration and hard work. His contracts with Chanel and Fendi are for life.    \"Chanel died doing her last collection in her 90s, so I have time. I don't think like this. It's my projection, always six months, six months, six months. I don't know. People laugh at me to disappear but I'm not ready for that one.    \"I am born for the battlefield.

By subway?    Barclays has paid $300 million for the naming rights to the New Jersey Nets arena.    New York's struggling Metropolitan Transportation Authority has sold the naming rights to the second-busiest subway stop in Brooklyn. The Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street Station will now have the name of a British bank, Barclays, added to it.    Several subway riders are outraged that Barclays has purchased the naming rights to this subway stop, which sees about 10 million people go through it each day.    One straphanger said, \"A London Bank shouldn't be the name of this train station; it's something that belongs to the public domain.\"    Another said, \"It's just everywhere we go, everything we do, it's just branding, branding, branding. It's America now.\"    Renaming the Atlantic-Pacific Station is tied to the construction of Barclays Center, the new sports arena for the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets.    Barclays is paying developer Forest City Ratner $300 million for naming rights to this arena. Ratner, in a separate deal, will be paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority $200,000 a year for the next 20 years to rename this commuter hub.    Authority Press Secretary Jeremy Soffin said, \"Like transit systems all over the U.S. and around the world, we are facing budget deficits.\"    In an effort to bridge the authority's $1 billion deficit, the transit giant that oversees the operation of the city's subways, buses and rail lines wants to follow the Barclays example with stations throughout the system.    Though the Atlantic-Pacific subway station is the first in New York for which naming rights have been sold, across the country, there have been several cases of public transportation systems using naming rights to increase revenue.    In 2003, the Las Vegas monorail system signed a 12-year, $50 million deal with Nextel to put its name on the station in the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Cleveland Bus System sold station names to two hospitals for $1.1 million a year.    Internationally, Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority has been selling the naming rights of 23 metro stations.    However, not all naming rights deals are successful. In 2001, the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority tried to raise $22 million by auctioning the naming rights to four historic \"T\" stations. It received no bids.    Reassuring the public that there are certain lines they won't cross when it comes to renaming stations of historical value, Soffin said, \"It's a very clear line there, and we want to be as open as possible, but we're not sort of selling the shop here.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/d98d9fbfdc31e014c3c15fc0ffced63d8d07ad79.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is threatening of stripping him of captaincy ?", "id": "108227", "answers": [{"text": "Sutcliffe", "answer_start": 1191}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Soccer star John Terry's role as captain of England's national team is in jeopardy following tabloid accusations of his marital infidelity, according to a British government minister.    Terry is alleged to have had an affair with the ex-partner of his former Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge, having failed in a high court bid to prevent newspapers publishing details of his liaison with Vanessa Perroncel.    The 29-year-old has two children with his wife Toni, whom he married in June 2007, and was named \"2009 Dad of the Year\" by a British sauce maker. He reportedly earns more than $200,000 a week.    French actress and model Perroncel had a child with Terry's fellow England defender Bridge in 2006. The pair have since separated but Bridge, who is now at English club Manchester City, said on Saturday that he would not be commenting for the sake of their son.    Sports Minister Gerry Sutcliffe said he would contact the English Football Association about the matter, the UK Press Association reported.    \"On the field John Terry is a fantastic player and a good England captain, but to be the captain of England you have got to have wider responsibilities for the country,\" Sutcliffe said.    \"And clearly if these allegations are proven -- and at the moment they are only allegations -- then it does call into question his role as England captain.    \"I speak to the FA on a regular basis, so I will be asking what their viewpoint is and we will see what comes of it.\"    Perroncel has enlisted the services of noted celebrity publicist Max Clifford, PA reported, and he said she told him that some of the allegations were true.    \"She has never spoken to a single journalist and she's all over all the papers with all kinds of allegations, some of which she said were true and some of which she said aren't true,\" Clifford told the GMTV television program.    \"All I'm prepared to say is that she's known John a long time, and obviously I think during that time they've become very close friends, but anything more than that, I wouldn't want to say at this particular stage. It's really for her to decide what she wants to do.\"    While Terry's alleged infidelity may not have the global impact as that of golf superstar Tiger Woods, it could cause big problems for England ahead of June's World Cup finals in South Africa.    Bridge, who is sidelined with injury, is not guaranteed to be part of the squad but has represented his country 36 times and is the regular back-up at left-back for Chelsea's Ashley Cole.    England coach Fabio Capello is out of the UK following a knee operation, but is expected to make a decision on Terry's future before the friendly international against African Nations Cup winners Egypt on March 3, PA reported.    The FA has released a statement saying that Capello, known to be a strict disciplinarian, \"alone will make the decision about John Terry's position.\"    \"Fabio is fully up to speed with developments regarding John Terry. He spoke with our chairman Lord Triesman and chief executive Ian Watmore today, who both backed him to make the best decision for England on footballing grounds,\" the FA said on its Web site on Monday evening.    \"Fabio is dealing with the matter in his own way using his extensive experience as a football manager.\"    Terry was first named captain of England after the 2006 World Cup when Steve McClaren took over as manager from Sven Goran Eriksson, and retained the armband when Capello was appointed in 2008.    It is not the first time that Terry has been the subject of controversy.    Last year he was accused by a tabloid paper of accepting money to show fans around Chelsea's training ground, and in 2002 he was cleared by a court after being charged with assault and affray following an incident with a nightclub bouncer."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/0b74f694e057a564258dc55d8276cf426a63e84a.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What kind of treatment did she receive?", "id": "108228", "answers": [{"text": "for iron deficiency,", "answer_start": 350}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized Thursday after falling ill in her chambers, the court confirmed.

Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism.  \"As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,\" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester.  Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double.  He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks.  The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan.  However, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on British soil were increasingly inspired by al Qaeda cadres in other countries, including in Iraq and East Africa.  \"There is no doubt now that al Qaeda in Iraq aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Iraq. There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa -- particularly in Somalia -- which is focused on the UK,\" he told the Society of Editors meeting.  According to Evans, there had been \"no decrease\" in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War.  He said that resources that could be devoted to counter-terrorism were instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others.  \"A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,\" he said.

Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev announced Tuesday that \"all due procedures\" were being initiated to close the base.    \"It's regrettable that this is under consideration by the government of Kyrgyzstan, and we hope to have further discussions with them,\" Clinton told reporters Thursday after a meeting with French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. \"But we will proceed in a very effective manner no matter what the outcome of the Kyrgyzstan government's deliberations might be.\"    Bakiyev made his announcement at a news conference in Moscow, Russia, following news reports of a multimillion-dollar aid package from Russia to Kyrgyzstan.    Lavrov said on Russian television that his country intends to help get vital cargo -- but no weapons or troops -- to NATO troops in Afghanistan. The United States asked to transport the cargo through Russian territory to Afghanistan, Lavrov said.    The U.S. military is planning to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to halt a resurgence of the Taliban.    Gen. David Petraeus, who oversees U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, described Manas as having \"an important role in the deployment of these forces\" and in refueling aircraft.    Senior State Department officials said the State and Defense departments are working with Kyrgyzstan to keep the lease to the base.    The officials said the Kyrgyzstan government has not yet responded to an offer to renew the lease. Discussions are being conducted through the U.S. Embassy in Kyrgyzstan and relevant State Department and Pentagon bureaus, the officials said.    One official said the United States has almost 18 months to renegotiate the lease before it expires and hopes Kyrgyzstan will reconsider their position.    Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell called Manas \"a hugely important air base.\"    \"It provides us with launching point to provide supplies in Afghanistan. We very much appreciate [Kyrgyz] support in using that base, and we hope to continue,\" he said at a daily news briefing earlier this week.    Clinton said the Defense Department \"is conducting an examination as to how else we would proceed that will not affect whatever decisions we make.\"    Petraeus was in Kyrgyzstan last month, partly to lobby the government to allow the United States to keep using the base. He said he and Kyrgyz leaders did not discuss at all the possible closure of the base and said local officials told him there was \"no foundation\" for news reports about the issue.    The mountainous former Soviet republic is Central Asia's second poorest country. The United States pays about $63 million a year for use of the base and employs more than 320 Kyrgyz citizens there, Petraeus said. The base has been in operation since December 2001 under U.N. mandate.    The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported Tuesday that Russia would offer Kyrgyzstan a $300 million, 40-year loan at an annual interest rate of 0.75 percent, and write off $180 million in Kyrgyz debt.    Kyrgyzstan also is home to a Russian military base, at Kant, that officially opened in 2003.    Kyrgyz Prime Minister Igor Chudinov told Russian news agency Interfax it was coincidence that talk of the base closure comes at the same time as the loan.    \"The Russian decision to grant a major loan has nothing to do with the pullout of the U.S. air base from the Kyrgyz territory,\" Chudinov said.    The relationship between the United States and Kyrgyzstan was damaged when a U.S. airman killed a Kyrgyz citizen in December 2006. The airman was transferred out of Kyrgyzstan, and the dead man's family was offered compensation. Petraeus said in January an investigation into the death was being reopened.    In announcing the base closure, Bakiyev said he was not satisfied with the inquiry and that his government's \"inability to provide security to its citizens\" was proving a serious concern.

A Zimbabwean family bury their relative, who died of cholera, 25km from Harare, Zimbabwe.    Malnutrition has left this baby born in Zimbabwe fighting for her life. She is the face of an unfolding crisis in a country once known as Africa's bread basket.    Today a loaf of bread costs $35 million worthless Zimbabwean dollars, and people are forced to sift through garbage piles for any morsel of food. Others huddle for warmth around a fire burning inside the shell of a broken-down van.    All of these images were captured on video recently smuggled out of Zimbabwe by Solidarity Peace Trust, a South African human rights group.  Watch the disturbing images \u00bb    Zimbabwe's government maintains that the situation is being exaggerated by the West in an effort to exert pressure on President Robert Mugabe to leave office.    But the World Health Organization (WHO) says the desperate situation has triggered a widening cholera outbreak that has killed 775 people and infected more than 15,000.    \"You have to eat in the same place you sleep right next to the buckets, the same buckets that we used as toilets,\" one cholera patient says on the video. \"There is no water to bathe.\"    And little to eat. Women foraging for food in the bush find dry branches with only a few berries.    \"This packet of juice will be my supper tonight,\" one woman says.    Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai -- who is still trying to form a unity government with Mugabe under a recent power-sharing deal -- said the situation can only be addressed once a \"legitimate government\" is in place.    \"Once there is a legitimate government, it is up to that government to deal with the problems the country is facing, which are quite wide-ranging,\" Tsvangirai told CNN on Wednesday.    \"But the immediate intervention of the health crisis has exacerbated the situation to the extent that it has now become an international crisis.\"    The WHO says the current cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has a high fatality rate because sufferers are either not able to reach health centers in time or that the health centers lack the capacity to treat the cases.    \"The epidemic is clearly on the increase,\" Dr. Eric Laroche, a WHO official in Harare, told CNN on Wednesday. \"I think it's going to last for several months.\"    In addition to the WHO, the Red Cross has responded to the outbreak and is sending staff and medical supplies into Zimbabwe.    Zimbabwe's main hospitals have all but shut down and the small clinics equipped by international aid organizations are overcrowded and unable to cope with the thousands of cholera patients. Health workers inside Zimbabwe believe scores are dying at home.    Laroche said the WHO is receiving cooperation from the government, but the health care system is abysmal.    \"The quality of the care, the supplies that come inside Zimbabwe, also need to be restored,\" Laroche said. \"So there's a lot of work to do, because the health system is collapsing for the time being.\"    One Zimbabwean health care worker, who would not show his face on the video, said he fears the death toll will skyrocket.    \"People are dying even at the health institution,\" he said. \"It's beyond control. We are going to witness so many deaths in the coming weeks.\"    He expressed frustration that so many people are dying from cholera, a disease that \"is both preventable and curable.\"    \"Nobody should die from cholera,\" he said. \"We are quite unfortunate.\"    Zimbabwe, already experiencing an economic crisis, was struck with the raging water-borne cholera in August. Health experts say the battle against the disease can only be won if Harare has adequate water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse properly.    Zimbabwe's information minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said Tuesday that the country has enough chemicals to purify water and enough money to buy pipes to mend sanitation lines.    He maintained that the outbreak is under control, blaming the West for causing the crisis as an excuse for military intervention.    International leaders -- including U.S. President George W. Bush, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Kenyan premier Raila Odinga -- have recently called for Mugabe to step down for failing to contain the cholera outbreak.    Frustration inside Zimbabwe is building. Last week, doctors and nurses protested over the lack of medical supplies and other resources at the country's hospitals.    Labor unions have protested over the deteriorating economy. Even soldiers once shielded from economic hardships by the Mugabe regime went on a rampage last week when they were unable to access wages from the country's banks.    Human rights activist Elinor Sisulu, who has lived and worked in Zimbabwe and now coordinates civil action outside the country, called on African leaders to demand Mugabe step down before Zimbabwe explodes.    \"In any population where you have high levels of desperation, anger and ... people arrive at the conclusion that we've tried a peaceful political process and this is not working, then anything can happen,\" she said.    -- CNN's Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg, South Africa contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/eea6da1e24147299a1148a6217dd61810d184e70.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What were they trying to do?", "id": "108232", "answers": [{"text": "she and her parents attempted to flee the besieged city on Sunday in a car", "answer_start": 763}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- One video showed the tiny face of the slain girl wrapped in a shroud.      Someone pulled back a bandage to show her bloodied right eye. Her mouth was frozen, slightly ajar. Her vacant face and lifeless head conjured the image of an alabaster bust.      Another more gruesome video showed the girl before she was cleaned for burial. She lay sprawled on a pavement, bloodied and disheveled, like a crime victim caught in a tabloid snapshot.      The images surfaced Sunday and Monday in Syria, where more than 2,000 people have died in five months of bloody conflict between security forces and anti-government demonstrators.      The victim was O'laa Jablawi, a 2 1/2-year-old girl from the besieged port city of Latakia, shot in the eye and killed when she and her parents attempted to flee the besieged city on Sunday in a car that came under fire, activists said.      They were among those who fled as security forces cracked down on al-Ramel, a Latakia neighborhood that has been the center of anti-government demonstrations.      Syrian security forces told residents to get out during the military offensive, which occurred by sea as well as land. According to human rights activists and anti-government protesters, that's exactly what the girls' parents tried to do -- flee.      Activists said she was shot by security forces. The Syrian government has yet to comment. The activists believe her father was shot in the shoulder and possibly detained. The mother's fate is unknown.      On one video, a voice shrieks, \"She's just a child. He killed her, the evil Bashar al-Assad,\" a reference to the nation's president.      On another, a voice says, \"Look, these are Bashar al-Assad's reforms.\"      CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the videos and the reports about them, so it is very difficult to find out how the child died.      The United Nations, global leaders, and human rights organizations all have urged the Syrian government to allow humanitarian workers, U.N. representatives and the media access to the country. Those pleas have had no effect.      But the videos are the latest in a series of grisly and disturbing images to emerge from the country.      Protesters consistently say the government is responsible for the conflict and bloodshed. Syria has consistently blamed the violence in the country on armed gangs.      Nevertheless, O'laa was an innocent, caught in the crossfire of an intensifying battle between those calling for freedom and a regime intent on staying in power.      Back in May, the U.N. Children's Fund, or UNICEF called on the government to spare civilians, particularly women and children, amid reports of youthful casualties.      \"While UNICEF cannot verify the reported cases and events, we are particularly disturbed by the recent video images of children who were arbitrarily detained and suffered torture or ill-treatment during their detention, leading in some cases to their death,\" the agency said.      Asked for an update, a UNICEF spokesman said there is \"nothing really to add\" from the May statement.

Mary Murphy says she was abused by her ex-husband during their nine-year marriage.    Murphy -- the vivacious judge on Fox TV's \"So You Think You Can Dance\" -- told CNN's Larry King that she wants other victims to learn from how she endured, but escaped, domestic violence.    Discovering her talent with dance eventually changed her life and helped her flee the relationship after nine years, she said.    Her ex-husband strongly denied that he ever physically or mentally abused Murphy, whom he married in 1978 soon after they met as teenagers in college.    \"I did just tuck it away and just buried it and went on with my life and I thought that, you know, I could leave it there and I wanted to leave it there until my father died a couple years ago,\" Murphy said.  Watch Murphy discuss abuse in her marriage \u00bb    Discussions with her dying father led to him apologizing for not being \"my knight in shining armor\" by intervening, she said.    But Murphy said seeing a photo of singer Rihanna's bruised face, taken soon after Brown's admitted attack last February, convinced her to go public with the story.    \"I still had no intention to talk to anybody until I saw Rihanna's face and seeing that just brought it all up.\"    \"Abuse, it just survives and thrives in silence,\" Murphy said.    US Weekly magazine's current issue offers a detailed version of Murphy's revelations in its cover story.    Murphy tells the magazine about a whirlwind romance that began in 1977 when she was a 19-year-old Ohio State University student -- swept off her feet by an 18-year-old who was \"extraordinarily handsome.\"    She told King that the marriage began \"getting out of control\" after just three months when her husband's jealously triggered fights.    \"It increased until we started to have just horrible fights,\" she said. \"And then at the time, after a fight in which I didn't want to have sex, it just escalated to the point that he literally had to rape me in order for me to have sex.\"    When a neighbor called police to her home, Murphy said she was too frightened to press charges.    \"I looked at him and with the look on his face, I said 'absolutely not' and went back in my room and just laid there and cried,\" she said.    Murphy said she left her husband several times over the nine-year marriage, but \"there weren't the shelters that there are today.\"    \"I did try to leave, and I was having a hard time making it, and he would sweet talk me and I would go back\" she said. \"It was back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And I don't feel really proud of that.\"    Murphy discovered her talent and love of dance several years into the marriage when she took a summer job at a dance studio while her husband was away for several months running the family's business in the Middle East, she said.    \"It made me feel beautiful instead of how I was probably really feeling inside, totally ashamed and dirty,\" she said.    Their marriage ended only after she and her husband renewed their vows in a wedding ceremony in front of his family and friends in Amman, Jordan, in 1985.    She learned he had a girlfriend -- to whom he was engaged -- in the Middle East. It was his infidelity that convinced her to divorce him, she said.    Her former husband -- who spoke to Larry King off the air -- said he was \"totally shocked\" by Murphy's account of their marriage. \"I never harmed her,\" he said.    \"If all of these allegations are true, she could have had me deported,\" he said. He is not a U.S. citizen.    He questioned if her motivation was \"more fame or sympathy.\"    Still, he said he is \"very, very proud\" of her.    Murphy told King his response is what she expected.    \"I think a lot of men out there, by the way, that when they do get married they feel like this is their right to do whatever they want to do, and it's not,\" she said. \"And I was a scared, frightened person.\"    Murphy said she is still afraid of her former husband.    \"I'm not going to lie to you that he still scares me,\" she said. \"I still live in fear that he will do something to me, that I will go missing.\"    Fear of not being able to make it on her own still drives her today, she said.    \"I put this behind me, went out and worked like I've never worked before,\" she said. \"And I still work today like I could still be homeless.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/29ba104809ad68b1bbfcb6025ef595f481878185.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Governors of what states raise concerns?", "id": "108237", "answers": [{"text": "Idaho, Alaska, Texas, South Carolina and Louisiana", "answer_start": 629}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Though they support some federal action to help their states recover from the recession, several Republican governors said Sunday they plan to turn down a portion of what's offered in the stimulus bill that President Obama signed last week.  Gov. Haley Barbour said the stimulus bill would force Mississippi to raise taxes.  \"If we were to take the unemployment reform package that they have, it would cause us to raise taxes on employment when the money runs out -- and the money will run out in a couple of years,\" Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday.  The Republican governors of Idaho, Alaska, Texas, South Carolina and Louisiana expressed similar concerns. But one of their colleagues, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, had a message for them Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\"  When asked about broader complaints from lawmakers such as South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford about the stimulus package leading to more debt, Schwarzenegger responded, \"I am more than happy to take his money or [that of] any other governor in this country that doesn't want to take this money. I take it because I think California needs it.\"  Schwarzenegger said he does not foresee a need for a tax hike in the future to sustain the unemployment provisions.  In a separate interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Schwarzenegger said the complaints are \"partially\" right, but that using the money for now \"cannot hurt.\" And another governor, Michigan Democrat Jennifer Granholm, told CNN, \"We'll take it.\"  Watch how stimulus package could affect your paycheck \u00c2\u00bb  \"South Carolina, I'll take your money. Louisiana, we'll take it,\" Granholm said in an interview recorded last week and broadcast Sunday on \"State of the Union.\"  \"We got plenty of work here, plenty of jobs that we would like to create here,\" Granholm added as she discussed the struggling auto industry and job losses in her state.  A leading Democrat, meanwhile, said he does see a potential problem.  \"I'm not sure that we can, over the long run, cope with the high unemployment compensation standard that this mandates for states,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, the head of the National Governor's Association, told \"Fox News Sunday.\"  \"But I don't care. My people are suffering,\" he added. \"They need that extra money. And right now that's paramount in my mind.\"  At issue is a portion of the unemployment assistance stipulated by the stimulus bill, which provides federal dollars to expand unemployment insurance in the states. In exchange for accepting that, states would have to expand the number of people who are given jobless benefits.  In Louisiana, for example, that portion of the funds would total nearly $100 million, state officials said. Gov. Bobby Jindal, a rising GOP star, has announced plans to turn it down.  \"The $100 million we turned down was temporary federal dollars that would require us to change our unemployment laws,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"  \"That would have actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses. We as a state would have been responsible for paying for those benefits after the federal money disappeared.\"  The law demands a \"permanent\" change to state law, Jindal said.  Jindal and the other governors do plan to accept other funds offered by the stimulus, including money to increase benefits for those who are receiving them. And even some governors who have expressed disappointment in the stimulus package are not shying away from any of the funding.  \"I don't like this bill, but it is now the law. ... It's now our responsibility and opportunity to try to implement it,\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told \"Fox News Sunday.\"  Calling his state \"a major net subsidizer of the federal government,\" he said, \"We're paying the bill either way -- we're going to take our share of the money.\"  In the end, some governors who would like to turn down a portion of the federal funding may not be able to. The law stipulates that state legislatures can overrule governors.  Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, said Americans are making it clear to all governors that they should accept whatever help they can get.  \"Everywhere across the country, certainly in Massachusetts ... people want their roads repaired, they want their bridges repaired, they want a clean energy strategy ... and real alternatives, and they want us to be candid with them about those needs,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/571b18757fe9d74f9df0220b4c875b9d9fe4c9a8.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "who launches awareness campaign?", "id": "108240", "answers": [{"text": "The Hopenhagen Web site", "answer_start": 1856}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- To guard against public indifference to climate change the United Nations has enlisted a coalition of the world's leading advertising agencies.    The world in their hands: New campaign aims to empower public.    Leading up to the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen in December, the global \"Hopenhagen\" campaign has been unveiled. The initiative is aiming to generate active interest and persuade the public into believing they have a say in the negotiations between world leaders that will ratify a new global climate treaty.    \"Climate change is one of the epic challenges facing this and future generations. World leaders will come together for the Copenhagen climate change conference in December, and every citizen of the world has a stake in the outcome. It is time to seal a deal. We need a global movement that mobilizes real change,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a press statement.    \"It is about global action for a global climate treaty and a better future for humankind.\"    The campaign is a collaboration between a number of the world's largest communications companies. The strategy and creative concept for the Hopenhagen idea came from WPP's Ogilvy & Mather team; digital framework and direction were developed by MDC Partners' Colle+McVoy; and the global PR and messaging plans are spearheaded by Omnicom Group's Ketchum.    Michael Lee, executive director of the International Advertising Association called the coalition of media companies involved \"unprecedented,\" adding that it was \"testament to the significance the industry places on the need for action to address climate change.\"    According to the campaign brief, the aim is to change from the idea that we are just \"coping\" with global climate challenges to \"hoping\" and ultimately acting to combat the perils of climate change.    The Hopenhagen Web site will be the center of an open source campaign where the public can send messages to the delegates of the UN summit meeting as well as raise awareness and debate issues.    While the Web site will be developed as the months go by, the IAA also hopes that businesses, governments and NGOs engage in the campaign as well to create a broad global community with shared goals.    Unveiled at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival this week, the first elements of the campaign can be seen at New York's JFK International, LA International and London Heathrow airports.    From September a more \"aggressive\" consumer launch of the campaign will commence until the conference begins on December 7.    What do you think?

He is the author of \"Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-39\" and \"Financial Crises and What to Do About Them.\"    Barry Eichengreen says Barack Obama will have to fix the credit crisis, the auto industry and trade policy.    BERKELEY, California (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama has been holding his economic cards close to his vest. He did not participate in person at last weekend's meeting of G20 leaders.    He has been reluctant to encourage the lame-duck Congress to adopt a major fiscal stimulus package.    He may be right in saying that the U.S. has only one president at a time. But this makes it all the more important that he hit the ground running on January 20.    This will mean, first of all, addressing the credit crisis. Despite all the actions of the Fed and the Treasury, the banks are still not lending. In some cases this is because their own finances are weak. But in others it is because they have other more convenient uses for their funds, ranging from acquisitions to dividend payments.    This reflects a flawed bank recapitalization scheme that gives the government no voting shares in the banks into which it is injecting public funds and hence no say in their decisions. Fortunately (as it were) there will be an opportunity to correct this, since as the recession deepens there will be more loan losses and the need for more capital injections. The next round of public money should come with voting rights so that taxpayers' interests are protected.    Then there is the need for increased public spending on infrastructure and federal grants to state and local governments to offset the collapse of private spending.    Candidate Obama spoke of $150 billion of fiscal stimulus. But if this recession turns out to be the deepest since World War II, as now seems certain, the appropriate figure will be at least four times that large. Anything less would fail to cushion the downturn.    A trillion-dollar deficit will excite fears of government out of control if not accompanied by a plan to balance the budget once the recession ends. The new president therefore will need to offer not just a stimulus package but also a multiyear budget.    Then there is the problem of the auto industry. The best course normally would be Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This would allow the Big Three to shed bad management and contracts, both of which would be thrown out in the bankruptcy process.    If GM, Ford or Chrysler is then able to come up with a viable business plan, they should be able to obtain the new money, known as debtor-in-possession financing, needed to implement it.    Admittedly, the credit crisis makes new money difficult to obtain. But if this is a problem, then the government can provide the debtor-in-possession financing. In other words, it can make its aid conditional on the Big Three first going through bankruptcy workouts.    A further complication arises from the fact that cars last for years and when they break down are expensive to repair. Warranties matter, in other words. If a producer was undergoing bankruptcy reorganization, from which it might or might not emerge, consumers would question whether its warranties were worth the paper they were written on.    But if this is the problem, then the government can guarantee the warranties. It could reimburse the cost of major repairs subject to terms and conditions. It is not as if our government has been reluctant to guarantee other products, ranging from bank deposits to money market mutual funds. And this guarantee should be provided only to auto companies that undergo bankruptcy reorganization.    Finally, it will be important for the new president to reassure our foreign partners about his economic intentions. There may be jubilation in Kenya and Indonesia over the election of a candidate they may view as a native son, but there is trepidation in Asia and Latin America about his protectionist rhetoric.    President Obama will need to reassure Mexico that while he believes in labor and environmental standards, he also believes in NAFTA. He should encourage the Congress to ratify our free trade agreements with Colombia and Korea. He should reassure the Chinese, who now have economic problems of their own, that he will not bash them over their exchange rate policies.    If Obama wishes to help Americans impacted by import competition there are better ways. He can expand trade adjustment assistance for displaced workers. He can propose wage insurance -- partial compensation for a limited period for workers moving to lower-paid jobs.    He can ramp up spending on education and training. He can address concerns over the environment by proposing a carbon tax rather than allowing blame for global warming to be shifted to Mexico and China.    That should be enough to keep the new president occupied for his first 100 days.

Bob Greene says he and his family didn't expect to be able to enjoy this Mother's Day.    (CNN) -- This is the Mother's Day we thought was going to be empty.    Last summer, my brother, my sister and I got the news like a sucker-punch to the stomach: Our mother's health, which had not been good for some time, had taken a sudden turn for the worse. A very compassionate hospice evaluator came to her home and said that, although one could never be absolutely certain, the end was quite near.    \"It may be two days. It may be two weeks.\"    Those were the words. We tried to process them.    She would be gone from us by the fall.    Except ...    \"Debby just picked me up a book from the library, and I'm a few chapters into it,\" my mother said to me on the phone the other day.    She got better. \"Better\" does not mean great; she walks with some difficulty now, she is fragile in ways she once was strong, but on this Mother's Day that we all expected to be such a desolate one for us, she's here.    On that morning the woman from hospice first came to visit, our mother was in her bed in the same room where our father, 10 years ago, had slowly died. Toward the end, he had not been able to get out of his bed, and we foresaw the same awful drama unfolding in the same way in the same bedroom. It was going to be even more wrenching to witness this time around.    But somehow, from somewhere inside herself, she decided: \"Not yet.\"    I don't say that glibly; I know that most men and women, in the months of their dying, do not have a choice about whether they will regain a semblance of their health. There comes a point when there is little to do but give in as gracefully as possible.    Our mother didn't. And while my brother and sister and I cherish the extra time we have been given with her, the most moving thing is to quietly behold how fiercely she is cherishing the extra time she has been given with the world -- the extra time she has been given with life itself.    That book from the library my sister brought her, it is one of many she has read since last summer. It's as if she realized that, if the prediction had been right -- if she had left us within two days or two weeks -- she never would have known the pleasure of reading another book. She has loved reading all her life; now she is reading new books with a sense of gratitude that we can literally feel.    She got to watch one more presidential campaign. She has always taken her responsibility as a citizen with utter seriousness.    She thought, last summer, that she would never know who the next president would be. But as, little by little, she got better during the fall, I can guarantee you that not even Wolf Blitzer or John King followed the day-to-day fluctuations of the campaign with more devotion than she did.    She used to joke with our father that their trips together to the polling place were ultimately a waste of time: He was on one end of the political spectrum, she was on the other, and, as she put it, \"Our votes always canceled each other's out.\" She was born during the Woodrow Wilson administration -- and in November, against all odds, she got to cast a ballot for president one more time.    Whenever my brother flies to central Ohio to visit her, he goes not straight from the airport to her house; he makes a stop. He picks up some pizzas at Rubino's on East Main Street in Bexley, and he has them in his hands as he walks through her front door. She hasn't tasted her last Rubino's pizza, not yet -- she thought she had, and each slice is a reminder of the good things that life still holds for her.    She enjoys the television series \"Brothers and Sisters\"; each Sunday evening, as she tells us that she is preparing to watch it, we know that it is seemingly small things like that, things that once felt mundane to her -- an hour with a favorite program -- that she relishes anew.    Over the holidays, I bought her the complete DVD series of \"The Sopranos.\" She is an admirer of great acting, and she was enthralled by the talent of James Gandolfini during the original run of the show; she has watched the entire arc of \"The Sopranos\" again, from the first episode to the last, and she did it in a hurry. You never know how much time you are given.    It might not be the worst way for any of us to live, even those of us who are much younger than she is; it might not be a bad idea for us to live as if someone has told us, \"It may be two days. It may be two weeks.\" Imagining those words is a pretty good reminder that we should savor every hour we are given.    My brother, my sister and I don't fool ourselves; just as warm days in March are sometimes followed by snow and ice, we realize that our mother's return to vibrancy may turn out to be a false spring. Yet even if it is a brief illusion, it is a springtime that brings tears of thanks to our eyes. In October, she will turn 90, if she, and we, are lucky.    But that's the wrong way to put it. If we are lucky?    We are.    This is the Mother's Day we didn't think we'd have. And I think she knows exactly what is in our hearts.

The pop star arrived in Malawi on Sunday.  Madonna holds her adopted Malawian son, David Banda, in 2007.  \"The family, I'm told, were admittedly reluctant to agree to this, but they've softened after learning more about this, the upbringing that Mercy will be given and they think perhaps it is in her best interest,\" ITN reporter Martin Geisler told CNN.  The girl, who is about 4, is named Mercy James. Her uncle is scheduled to sign adoption agreement papers in a Malawian court on Monday, Geisler said.  Geisler said Malawians' public opinion toward Madonna softened after she was interviewed by the Malawi Nation newspaper and released family photographs showing a happy David Banda -- a Malawian boy she adopted more than two years ago.  \"The sense, I'm told, in Malawi after that, was, 'Well, the little boy looks well, he looks happy, he looks well looked after. Perhaps we shouldn't be so hard on her,'\" said Geisler.  A British children's charity earlier asked the pop star to reconsider her reported plans to adopt a girl from the country.  Save the Children spokesman Dominic Nutt said the child would be better off staying in Malawi than being raised by the recently divorced singer, who has three other children, including the adopted Malawian boy.  \"The best place for a child is in his or her family in their home community,\" he said. \"Most children in orphanages have one parent still living, or have an extended family that can care for them in the absence of their parents.\"  Critics of the singer had argued she should donate money to orphanages in Malawi, rather than adopt another child.  The charity argued that foreign adoptions should happen only if a child does not have any relatives, and all other options have been considered.  The 50-year-old performer is a big supporter of Malawi. She made a documentary, \"I Am Because We Are,\" which highlighted poverty and AIDS and other diseases devastating Malawi's children. She also helps run a nonprofit group, Raising Malawi, which implements initiatives to help the needy in the southeastern Africa nation.  On Sunday, Madonna toured the village of Chinkhota, assessing plans to build a school there and other possible Raising Malawi investments.

Diana once referred to her former butler Paul Burrell as \"my rock.\"    Burrell, who returned to Britain from his home in Florida to give evidence, was the first star witness of the London inquest, now in its fourth month.    His role as confidant to Diana, who died in a Paris car crash on August 31, 1997, along with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and hotel security chief Henri Paul, meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated.    Burrell, whom the late princess once called \"my rock,\" cast doubt on whether Diana was ready to marry Fayed. According to Burrell, the princess was still \"holding a candle\" for former boyfriend and heart surgeon Hasnat Khan -- who she called \"her soulmate\" -- when she started dating Fayed \"on the rebound.\"    Burrell told the inquest that Diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in June 1997 with her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with Muslim men.  \"She called the princess a 'whore' and she said that she was messing around with 'effing Muslim men' and she was 'disgraceful' and said some very nasty things,\" Burrell said. He agreed that, as a result of such calls Diana, decided not to talk to her mother again.    The inquest, which began in October and is expected to last another two or three months, aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the Princess and Dodi and determine their cause of death -- whether by accident or otherwise.    Asked earlier in the day if he believed that Fayed was \"the one,\" Burrell said \"no, I did not have that impression.\" He also cast doubt on claims that Fayed and Diana were engaged or on the cusp of engagement, saying: \"I find that difficult to believe.\"    Asked to explain himself, Burrell said: \"Because this was only a 30-day relationship and the princess had just finished a long-term relationship with someone (Khan) she cared deeply about. I knew that because I was there and I saw it.\"    Diana's 18-month relationship with Khan ended around the same time she started seeing Fayed in July 1997. Burrell said Diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with Khan might take place, given that Khan is Muslim.  Watch report on claims about Diana's marriage plans. \u00bb    Khan had not proposed to the princess, Burrell said, adding that Khan was \"the man she loved more than any other.\" He said he spoke to Diana about the possibility that Fayed would give her a ring shortly before her death.    Burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand, rather than the left, as is customary with engagement rings. \"I need marriage like a bad rash,\" Burrell claimed Diana told him.    Last month at the inquest Lady Annabel Goldsmith, a friend of Diana, said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage \"like a rash on my face.\"    Burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring, as the Fayed family has maintained. Fayed family spokesman Michael Cole testified last week that Dodi's father, Mohamed Al Fayed, was certain the couple had planned to marry.    Lawyers at the inquest asked Burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the Monday following the fatal car crash. There has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news, such as an engagement.    But Burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan. He said he had actually looked at Diana's schedule for that day and found only mundane items, and nothing to indicate she planned a special announcement.    Burrell also told the inquest he did not believe Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's, husband was involved in Diana's death.    Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi and the owner of Harrods department store, has long claimed that senior members of the royal family -- specifically the queen's husband, Prince Philip -- ordered the pair be murdered. He also claims that Diana was pregnant at the time of her death.    But Burrell said that he knew Prince Philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths.    \"I can tell you that is not Prince Philip's nature, \" he said. \"Plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren. Why would he want to harm her? It's not possible.\"    The inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which Prince Philip sent to Diana, with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters. But other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed, \"Pa.\"    Burrell explained that Philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks.    \"Prince Philip doesn't mix his words,\" Burrell said. \"He says it as it is, but he is not a nasty man. Prince Philip isn't known for his diplomacy. He was fond of the princess.\"    Burrell worked for the British royals for 21 years and became close to Diana after her separation from Prince Charles. He has written two books about his time with the princess.    In his second book, Burrell told of a letter from Diana which indicated she feared for her life. The princess wrote that Prince Charles planned \"'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury.\"    One of Diana's close friends, however, testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged. Lucia Flecha de Lima said on December 18 that Burrell was capable of imitating the princess's handwriting.    Lawyers questioned Burrell about the date of the letter. Burrell said it was written in October 1996, two months, after Diana and Charles divorced -- yet the letter refers to Charles as \"my husband.\"    Burrell responded that Diana always referred to Charles that way, even after the divorce.    The inquest has revealed that Diana was a prolific letter-writer who also received a lot of correspondence. Witnesses, including Burrell, recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk, with the more important ones stored in a special box.    Burrell testified that after Diana's death, her mother, Frances Shand-Kidd, worked every day for a week shredding the papers from Diana's desk. He said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on December 19, 1997.    It was at this meeting that Queen Elizabeth told Burrell: \"There are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge.\" That comment, which has been widely reported, was meant to warn him to be careful, Burrell said, and was not a warning about any one person or group of people.    At the same meeting Burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of Diana's belongings to keep safe.    The details of the conversation emerged when Burrell stood trial for their alleged theft in 2002, causing the case against him to collapse.

An investigator works the scene of the plane crash Friday outside Buffalo, New York.    Those are the reasons two would-be passengers did not fly on Continental Connection Flight 3407, which crashed Thursday outside Buffalo, killing all 49 people aboard and one on the ground.    \"It could have been me,\" David Becony said from his home in Springville, New York, as he watched television reports on the crash and its fiery aftermath. \"My wife would have been with all those families\" who had loved ones on the plane.    Becony missed the flight from Newark-Liberty International Airport to Buffalo Niagara International Airport because bad weather had delayed his earlier flight from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Newark.    Unable to get another flight and unable to find a hotel room near the airport, the supervisor for a demolition company decided to camp out on a seat in the terminal.

It wasn't a smooth ride, Becony said of his Friday flight. \"It was weird, shaky, knowing it was the same type of aircraft.\"    That type of aircraft was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft, operated by Colgan Air for Continental Connection's regional service.    \"I'm still in shock, really,\" said 49-year-old Becony, a Catholic. \"God was looking over me.\"    Becony is keeping his unused ticket for Flight 3407 as a reminder of how close he came.

Using her Blackberry to search Continental's Web site, she noted that the 7 p.m. flight was delayed by only about 20 minutes, so she asked the gate agent whether she could get on the standby list for that flight.    \"He said, 'It's pretty open ... easy eight standby seats. You won't have a problem getting on it,' she said . \"I said, 'Can you put me on standby?' He said, 'No, you've got to go on the customer service line.' \"    But that line \"was a gazillion deep because of all the delays,\" enough to dissuade her from making the switch. \"I said, ehhh.\"    When she heard about the crash, Reinhardt was happy for her good fortune but shaken nevertheless. \"The heart-wrenching piece for me was, I was at the gate talking to this gate agent, and a young woman came up and she wanted to know: Should she stay on the 7 o'clock flight because of all the delays? Did the gate agent think the 4:30 was going to get out before the 7?    \"He said, 'No, you will still get in before the 4:30,' and she said, 'OK, I'm going to stay on the 7 o'clock; I'm calling my boyfriend.' And she did.\"    For a while, the two women stood together at the gate, both of them using their Blackberries to study the flight information. Then, they went their separate ways. \"I said, 'Good for you. Have a nice trip.' That's the killer for me.\"    Reinhardt said her flight was uneventful. She and the other passengers landed at the airport in Buffalo shortly before 11 p.m., oblivious to what had happened just minutes before and a few miles away.    \"I walked out, and I saw all these people standing there, and I'm thinking, 'It's Thursday at 11 at night.

Ed McMahon had suffered several health problems in recent years.    McMahon passed away peacefully shortly after midnight at the Ronald Reagan/UCLA Medical Center, his publicist, Howard Bragman, said Tuesday    McMahon, 86, was hospitalized in February with pneumonia and other medical problems.    He had suffered a number of health problems in recent years, including a neck injury caused by a 2007 fall. In 2002, he sued various insurance companies and contractors over mold in his house and later collected a $7 million settlement.    Though he later hosted a variety of shows -- including \"Star Search\" and \"TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes,\" McMahon's biggest fame came alongside Carson on \"The Tonight Show,\" which Carson hosted from 1962 to 1992.

I walked over and stood beside him. Finally the two guys finished, and Johnny asked, 'What have you been doing?' I told him. He said, 'Good to meet you, Ed,' shook my hand, and I was out of the office. The whole meeting was about as exciting as watching a traffic light change.\"  Watch McMahon discuss meeting Johnny Carson \u00bb    Though McMahon was surprised to be offered the job as Carson's sidekick, the two soon proved to have a strong chemistry. Carson was, by nature, introverted and dry-witted; McMahon was the boisterous and outgoing second banana, content to give Carson straight lines or laugh uproariously at his jokes (a characteristic much-parodied by comedians).  Watch Comedian Joan Rivers recall McMahon \u00bb    Carson made cracks about McMahon's weight, his drinking and the men's trouble with divorce. McMahon was married three times; Carson, who died in 2005, had four wives.    McMahon was also the show's designated pitchman, a talent he honed to perfection during \"Tonight's\" 30-year run with Carson, even if sometimes the in-show commercial spots fell flat.    For one of the show's regular sponsors, Alpo dog food, McMahon usually extolled the virtues of the product while a dog eagerly gobbled down a bowl. But one day the show's regular dog wasn't available, and the substitute pooch wasn't very hungry.    McMahon recalled the incident in his 1998 memoir, \"For Laughing Out Loud.\"    \"Then I saw Johnny come into my little commercial area. He got down on his hands and knees and came over to me. ... I started to pet Johnny. Nice boss, I was thinking as I pet him on the head, nice boss. By this point the audience was hysterical. ... I just kept going. I was going to get my commercial done.    \" 'The next time you're looking at the canned dog food ...' -- he rubbed his cheek against my leg --  ... reach for the can that contains real beef.' Johnny got up on his knees and started begging for more. I started petting him again ... and then he licked my hand.\"    McMahon also promoted Budweiser, American Family Insurance and -- during the most recent Super Bowl -- Cash4Gold.com. Entertainment Weekly named him No. 1 on its list of TV's greatest sidekicks.    Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, on March 6, 1923. His father was a promoter, and McMahon remembered moving a lot during his childhood.    \"I changed towns more often than a pickpocket,\" McMahon told People.    He later joined the Marines and served in World War II and Korea.    Though McMahon was well-rewarded by NBC -- the 1980 People article listed his salary between $600,000 and $1 million -- his divorces and some poor investments took their toll. In June 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported that McMahon was $644,000 in arrears on a $4.8 million loan for a home in Beverly Hills, California, and his lender had filed a notice of default.    McMahon and his wife, Pamela, told CNN's Larry King that McMahon had gotten caught in a spate of financial problems.    \"If you spend more money than you make, you know what happens. And it can happen. You know, a couple of divorces thrown in, a few things like that,\" said McMahon, who added that he hadn't worked much since the neck injury.

That fact will come as no surprise to the millions of people who have watched the iconic scene at the end of the smash hit film musical.      \"But they were quite comfortable,\" she assured CNN's Max Foster, \"despite what they looked like.\"      But those trousers, \"made of some sort of shark skin material\" she says, plus a string of memorable songs from the film including \"Summer Nights\" and \"You're The One That I Want\" helped propel Olivia Newton-John to superstardom which has continued to this day.      The British-born actress, who was raised in Australia from the age of five, was already an established singing star -- having won three Grammy Awards -- prior to being cast as Sandy Olssen alongside John Travolta's Danny Zuko in the 1978 film.      And many of the songs from that era still rank among her favorites in a recording career which has produced over 30 albums including the 1981 double platinum selling \"Physical\" -- which spawned the single of the same name and a craze for spandex and leg warmers.      \"The songs I did with John Farrar [the Australian producer and songwriter] are among my favorites. And a lot of those songs, 'Magic' and 'Suspended in Time' are on 'Xanadu,'\" [the soundtrack from the 1980 film].      Of her more recent recordings she cites 2006's \"Grace and Gratitude\" as another favorite. \"It was a healing CD that was very personal for me,\" she said.      After the runaway success of the early 1980s Newton-John was preparing for a comeback in 1992 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The diagnosis changed the course of her life forever.      After successfully beating the disease, Newton-John talked openly about her experience and became a passionate advocate for early detection and helping other women cope with the disease.      \"I'm so grateful to be here, 17 years after being diagnosed,\" she told CNN. \"I want to empower other women to be really observant of their breast health and do regular breast self-examination.\"      She also has a Website -- http://www.liv.com// -- which provides information on breast self-examination.      \"When I talk to women in my age bracket, they're afraid. I understand the fear but if there is something wrong, the earlier you find it, the better chance you have of a healthy outcome,\" she said.      Cancer awareness isn't the only cause she lends her name to. Along with her second husband John Easterling, who she married in 2008, Newton-John helps promote education about rainforests.      \"We're helping educate the children of the Amazon to realize the importance of the living rainforest so that when the timber and oil companies come in they know to save it.\"      Three decades on from her life-changing appearance in \"Grease\", Newton-John is still finding plenty things in her life to become hopelessly devoted to."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/deed60365bfbd7f23274346982306eb86fde457e.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who says Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan has been killed?", "id": "108262", "answers": [{"text": "Intelligence sources", "answer_start": 266}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- Somalia said a senior al Qaeda operative tied to several attacks in East Africa was killed Monday in a U.S. strike in southern Somalia.    Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan, pictured on the FBI's Web site, reportedly was tied to al Qaeda's East Africa operations.    Intelligence sources have confirmed to the Somali government that Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan was killed, Information Minister Dahir Mohamud Gelle said Tuesday.    \"We welcome that attack because those people targeted were murderers, and they are unwanted and unwelcome in Somalia,\" Gelle said.    Nabhan's death will have \"a major impact\" on al Qaeda's operations in the Horn of Africa, according to one regional analyst.    U.S. special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on a car Monday in southern Somalia, killing several people, including one they believed was Nabhan, U.S. officials told CNN earlier.    Nabhan, 30, was born in Kenya and had been tied to attacks that included the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, according to the sources. More than 200 were killed, and 4,000 wounded in those attacks, most of them Kenyans.    The United States targeted Nabhan in an airstrike in southern Somalia near the Kenyan border in March 2008, U.S. officials said at the time.    In February 2006, the FBI announced that Nabhan was wanted for questioning in connection with the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa, Kenya.    Ten Kenyans and three Israelis -- including two children -- were killed when three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside Mombasa's Paradise Hotel in November 2002.    The bombing took place within minutes of an unsuccessful missile attack on an Israeli charter jet, which was taking off with 261 passengers and 10 crew members.    President Obama signed off on Monday's operation, a senior U.S. official said. The United States had been monitoring the situation for days and had intelligence that Nabhan was in the area, the U.S. officials said.    The officials who talked to CNN are familiar with the latest information on Monday's strike but did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media.    The U.S. helicopter flew from a U.S. Navy warship offshore, while the ship kept watch on the operation, one of the sources said. The warship was ready to rescue the American troops if they got into trouble.    Farmers in the southeastern town of Barawe, Somalia, said they witnessed the assault. They said helicopters attacked a car and its occupants and that at least two people died. The witnesses said some helicopters landed and that some of the injured or dead were pulled into at least one helicopter.    A U.S. official said the troops landed to take away the body believed to be that of Nabhan for positive identification.    Nabhan is believed to be an associate of al Qaeda member Harun Fazul, who was indicted in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies.    The U.S. military has long sought Nabhan because he is believed to be deeply involved in al Qaeda's East African operations, a senior U.S. official said last year.    \"He was certainly one of the leading al Qaeda figures in East Africa,\" said Rashid Abdi, a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group, an independent advisory and analysis organization.    Nabhan \"has been living in the shadows\" in Somalia and not much is known about his recent activity, Abdi said.    \"The fact that he is now out of the picture will have a bigger impact on al Qaeda than on Al-Shabaab,\" he said, referring to the Islamist militia in Somalia that has ties to al Qaeda. \"He is a man with an important organizational memory, and if a key figure like him is killed, it always has a major impact.\"    Al-Shabaab is waging a bloody battle against Somalia's transitional government and is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations because of its al Qaeda ties.    There are growing concerns that Somalia could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan.    CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives.

Sheikh Jalal al-Din Ali al-Saghir is a parliament member and a representative of the most influential Shiite cleric.    Sheikh Jalal al-Din Ali al-Saghir, speaking at Buratha Mosque, blamed the corruption on followers of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.    Al-Saghir is the most senior representative in Baghdad of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, arguably the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq. As a member of Iraq's parliament, Al-Saghir represents the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, part of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance.    His political group dominates the Iraqi security forces and has been fighting members of a rival Shiite group, al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia.    He said the Supreme Council, part of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance, once had an armed group called the Badr Brigade that is now a renamed non-military organization. He repeated Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's call for all armed groups not affiliated with the government to disband.    \"We said from the beginning, and since 2003, the necessity of laying down the weapons by all, and the weapons should be in the hand of the state,\" al-Saghir said.    He praised Iraqi security forces' efforts in Basra, the southern Shiite city where al-Maliki launched an offensive in March. The cleric said al-Maliki freed the region of gangs.    \"We can say that the Iraqi security forces have made a great change in terms of establishing the security and imposing the law,\" al-Saghir said, adding that effective security must be imposed to ensure the fairness of this autumn's provincial elections.    \"The elections will be tomorrow,\" he said, meaning soon. \"How can we respect ourselves as politicians, political parties and officials within the government? How can we respect ourselves by saying we conduct honest elections while there are gangs controlling areas or provinces?\"    Meanwhile, Sadrist cleric Suhail al-Iqabi delivered a fiery sermon in the eastern part of Baghdad as hundreds of Sadr City residents sat on the street performing Friday prayers. Al-Iqabi said an \"act of genocide\" is taking place in the town.    Speaking to hundreds of worshippers chanting pro-Sadr slogans, al-Iqabi accused the government of holding a grudge against Sadrists and the people of Sadr City \"who are facing genocide in every sense of the word, cutting off the water, electricity and shelling the innocent civilians, killing women and children and detaining women.\"    His sermon included a prayer asking God to strengthen al-Sadr's Mehdi army and \"sharpen their weapons.\"    \"What the prime minister stated in his press conference, all that he said that was so far from reality, the nonsense and false accusations he used to cover up his huge failure leading the nation's affairs,\" al-Iqabi said. \"... We call on all politicians, journalists, intellectuals, civil society institutions, tribal leaders and clergy to visit Sadr City to witness the crimes committed by the occupier and government forces.\"    In Sadr City, nearly 1,000 civilians and fighters are thought to have been killed since late March in fighting between security forces and Shiite militants. However, al-Saghir said there has been \"good security progress.\"  Watch as fighting destroys a school \u00bb    \"I believe the coming days will witness many developments which will lead to the protection of this city from these gangs,\" he said.    He urged people who have grievances to make their voices heard through the political process. He decried those who arm themselves under the pretext of sectarianism or occupation.    Al-Saghir emphasized what he called corruption in Sadr City and the role of Sadrist followers in promoting it.    He noted that imams from the Supreme Council were booted from several mosques and replaced by politically correct imams, and he said companies have to pay off the Sadrists to get contracts. He said fuel tanker drivers face the risk of losing their trucks to fire or theft if they don't pay off political groups.    Meanwhile Friday, a U.S. soldier was killed in Baghdad after a roadside bomb struck the soldier's vehicle, the military said.    The soldier was part of a combat patrol in eastern Baghdad when a roadside bomb struck the patrol vehicle at about 6:15 p.m. local time.    The soldier's name is being withheld until family has been notified, the U.S. army's public affairs department in Baghdad said.    Also Friday, the U.S. military said one of the two suicide bombers who struck a wedding convoy this week in northern Iraq was a woman \"imitating pregnancy.\"    The military blamed the Sunni militant group al Qaeda in Iraq for Thursdays' attack that killed 35 people and wounded dozens more in Balad Ruz, a town northeast of Baghdad in the volatile Diyala province.    The U.S. military announced Friday that a U.S. Air Force drone crashed in southern Iraq, and investigators suspect mechanical failure. The MQ-1 Predator drone was used mainly for reconnaissance, the military said.    On Thursday, Iraqi lawmakers were in Iran to confront officials there with evidence of Tehran's support for militias and outlaws in Iraq, Iraqi officials said.    Iran's state-run news agency IRNA confirmed the delegation was in Tehran.    Parliament members from the ruling United Iraqi Alliance, the Shiite coalition, intended to discuss how the training and arming of militias is harmful for Iraq -- and for Iran as a neighbor, said Sami al-Askari, an adviser to al-Maliki.    Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said the delegation intended to provide evidence, confessions and pictures indicating that Iran is supplying weapons and training fighters inside Iraq.    Bush administration officials have said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force has provided training and weapons for militants in Iraq.

A woman lies next to her sick child at a medical center in Sheshemene, Ethiopia, in July.    The World Health Report 2008 aims to spotlight disparities in health care across the globe, and as the Nairobi example illustrates, the differences exist not only between the First and Third Worlds -- they can occur just across town.    WHO roundly criticizes the organization, finance and delivery of health care and calls advances in the field \"deeply and unacceptably unequal, with many disadvantaged populations increasingly lagging behind or even losing ground.\"    The report says that a citizen of a wealthy nation can live up to 40 years longer than someone in a poor country, and of the 136 million women who will give birth this year, about 58 million (43 percent) will receive no medical assistance during childbirth or the postpartum period.    UNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman said the sharp inequities in the cost and access to health care often speak to larger societal ills.    \"High maternal, infant and under-five mortality often indicates lack of access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation, immunizations and proper nutrition,\" she said in a statement.    WHO Director-General Margaret Chan insists the dilemma is not just a matter of haves versus have-nots.    \"A world that is greatly out of balance in matters of health is neither stable nor secure,\" she said in a statement from Almaty, Kazakhstan, where the report was released.    The difference in annual government expenditures on health care is more canyon than gap, according to the report. While the wealthiest nations dole out as much as $6,000 per person each year, some countries are unable or unwilling to spend more than $20 per person.    However, while calling for wide-ranging reforms in the delivery of primary health care, the report notes that it isn't always a matter of government expenditures.    Tajikistan and Sierra Leone both spend less than $100 per person on health care. But while the health-adjusted life expectancy in Sierra Leone is under 30 years of age, Tajikistan's is almost 70 -- a figure comparable to the United States, which spends more than $2,500 a person on health care.    \"When countries at the same level of economic development are compared, those where health care is organized around the tenets of primary health care produce a higher level of health for the same investment,\" the report says.    WHO defines primary health care as being \"universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by means acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford.\"    The organization's report -- titled \"Primary Health Care -- Now More Than Ever\" -- calls for a move toward universal coverage to reverse a trend over the last 30 years in which disparities in the levels of health care have actually widened.    Universal coverage, the report says, would lower the risks of disease outbreaks for everyone, not just the impoverished.    Currently, the most common means of paying for health care is out of pocket, which WHO says is the \"most inequitable method for financing health care services.\" The report says more than 100 million people fall into poverty in a given year because of health care bills.    Another problem, the report says, is that doctors tend not to focus on prevention.    \"Rather than improving their response capacity and anticipating new challenges, health systems seem to be drifting from one short-term priority to another, increasingly fragmented and without a clear sense of direction,\" according to the report.    But the report also handed out accolades, most notably to Iran and Cuba.    WHO applauded the Islamic Republic's 17,000 \"health houses,\" which serve about 1,500 people each. The report credited the centers with boosting Iranians' life expectancy from 63 to 71 years between 1990 and 2006.    And in Cuba, the nation's \"polyclinics\" have yielded one of the longest life expectancies (78 years) of any developing country, the report says.    The report called for all sectors of society to help determine how health care is allocated, and it singled out the United States for spending just 0.1 percent of its health budget on health systems research -- the kind of research that policymakers use to decide how money is spent.    The report also points to the pharmaceutical industry's impact on health care in the United States, where the average expenditure on prescription drugs in 2005 was $1,141 per person -- twice the average in Canada, Germany and Britain, and 10 times the average in Mexico.    To combat the problems facing global health care, WHO says in its report that nations must improve coverage and delivery, as well as policy and leadership. It acknowledges that primary health care isn't cheap, but asserts that the \"investment provides better value for money than its alternatives.\"    \"The legitimacy of health authorities increasingly depends on how well they assume responsibility to develop and reform the health sector according to what people value -- in terms of health and of what is expected of health systems in society,\" the report says."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/eb5a960f5370e3fcb34d7c2c3bf7ecd7f255cc3d.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did the replacement HMS Victory serve as in 1805?", "id": "108271", "answers": [{"text": "served as Admiral Nelson's flagship in the Battle of Trafalgar in", "answer_start": 1072}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Deep-sea explorers say they have solved \"one of the greatest mysteries in naval history\" with the discovery of what was \"the world's mightiest and most technically advanced warship\" when it sank in 1744.    The HMS Victory sank in 1744.    The HMS Victory -- the predecessor to a historic British flagship of the same name -- was found \"far from where history says it was lost,\" Odyssey Marine Exploration said in a news release Monday.    The find in the English Channel exonerates Adm. Sir John Balchin, one of \"the greatest admirals in English history,\" because it shows that the ship went down in a violent storm, not due to any mistakes he made, Odyssey said.    It did not specify the ship's exact location. Maritime lore said the ship went down in the northern part of the Channel Islands, south of England near the coast of France.    Stories about treasures -- including gold -- that may have been on the ship have existed ever since its disappearance.    This HMS Victory was a predecessor to the historic British ship that took the same name and which served as Admiral Nelson's flagship in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.    In court papers seeking exclusive salvage rights, Odyssey says the wreck site \"consists of cannons and other unidentified objects. Odyssey believes that potentially valuable cargo may be located at or near the site.\"    The papers were filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida, where Odyssey is based, seeking exclusive salvage rights.    There were nearly 1,000 people aboard -- \"900 sailors, plus a complement of marines and 50 volunteers drawn from the noblest families of England,\" Odyssey said in information about the ship released together with the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the find.    Based on reports from the time, there may be as much as four tons of gold on the ship, Odyssey and the Discovery Channel said.    \"Additional research indicates that there were large quantities of both silver and gold coins aboard. ... Research suggests that this prize money will also likely be located at the wreck site.    \"... However, no coins have been located at the site to date, and no accurate assessment as to their value can be made prior to location, recovery and analysis.\"    The potential treasure also comes in another form -- bronze weaponry. \"The site's anticipated ordnance collection\" includes \"the single largest collection of bronze cannon in the world\" and \"the largest consignment of bronze guns ever manufactured and preserved today,\" Odyssey said.    Two cannons have been recovered -- \"a 12-pounder featuring the royal arms of George II\" and a \"42-pounder bearing the crest of George I,\" it said.    \"The huge 42-pounder recovered is the only known example of a gun of this type and size currently in existence on dry land. The only other artifacts recovered to date were two small brick fragments that were brought into U.S. federal court in order to file an admiralty arrest of the site.\"    Admiralty arrest is a step mandated under international maritime law.    The discovery could set up a legal battle with the British government.    If it really is the HMS Victory, \"her remains are sovereign immune,\" the British Ministry of Defense (MOD) said in a statement on its blog Monday.    \"The wreck remains the property of the Crown. We have not waived our rights to it. This means that no intrusive action may be taken without the express consent of the United Kingdom.\"    In its statement, Odyssey said it \"has been cooperating closely\" with the ministry, and \"all activities at the site have been conducted in accordance with protocols agreed with MOD and Royal Navy officials.\"    The ship has deteriorated to the point that recovering it is impossible, Odyssey said. \"A plan is being developed for an archaeological excavation of the site, and artifacts will be recovered in accordance with a scientific project plan, which will be submitted to the UK MOD for review and approval.\"    The company has proposed that it be paid \"with either ... a percentage of the value of the collection that has been recovered, conserved and presented to the UK government, or a percentage of the coins or other artifacts that the government decides to (sell).\"    The ship was found nearly 100 km (62 miles) \"from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the Channel Islands,\" Odyssey's statement said.    \"Having discovered it in deep water far from where history says it was lost has served to exonerate Admiral Balchin and his officers from the accusation of having let the ship run aground on the Casquets due to faulty navigation,\" said Greg Stemm, Odyssey's chief executive officer, in the statement.    Odyssey said the \"prevailing belief\" about the ship's fate was that it had \"smashed into the Casquets, a group of rocky islets\" north of Guernsey, the second largest of the Channel Islands.    But the evidence, Odyssey's statement said, suggests \"the ship sank as the result of a violent storm and suggests that the design and construction of the ship contributed to her loss.\"    Odyssey released press materials about the ship in cooperation with the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the find and will be showing it in a program this week called Treasure Quest.    \"The English Channel is a treacherous place to navigate,\" Discovery Channel President John Ford told CNN Radio.    \"The ship was returning from Portugal and got caught up in a storm. And despite being judged unsinkable at the time, sort of like the Titanic was, this very, very large ship went down in a storm and vanished without a trace.\"    CNN Radio's April Williams contributed to this report"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f909f77ec37c7fd448e34247f546aa5b8793cad5.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what author said", "id": "108272", "answers": [{"text": "\"Some women can skip stages, some repeat a cycle of going back and forth to other steps and others go through the motions", "answer_start": 524}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The solution to ending an abusive relationship seems simple: Walk out the door.    But for an abused woman, leaving can be a confusing process, complex at every step, said a newly published article in an University of Illinois journal.    Co-author and graduate student Lyndal Khaw told CNN that abused women actually go through a five-step process of leaving that involves denial, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance.    And the transition from one step to another is hardly seamless, Khaw said.    \"Some women can skip stages, some repeat a cycle of going back and forth to other steps and others go through the motions -- going from one stage to another\", she said.    In their study, Khaw and co-author Jennifer Hardesty, an assistant professor of human and community development, applied their model to 25 abused women. The report was published recently in the Journal of Family Theory and Review.    Khaw said that moving from step to step can put a strain on those who are being supportive to an abused woman because they can have a hard time understanding why she returns or refuses to leave.    Hardesty said that physically leaving a relationship entails more than a woman's decision to embrace change and prioritizing her own safety. The abuser can affect her decisions, as can children, who can motivate her to return to the relationship, Hardesty said.    Even though a woman may return to the abuser at some point, practitioners and women themselves need to understand that every time the woman disengages she gains additional resources and support, Hardesty said.    \"So next time she is contemplating and preparing she'll be stronger and perhaps more likely to stay out of that relationship,\" she said.    Khaw said service providers, family members and other sources of support need to recognize the stages of what can be a lengthy -- and risky -- process.    \"When trying to leave, abusers may get more violent,\" Khaw said.    Recognition of the five-step process can be helpful to abused women, Hardesty said.    \"Not all women are ready to leave, but recognizing it's a process can be empowering,\" she said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/1d7e188d0be8a5c22b97c0debf2648b427dbd112.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where the deals are available?", "id": "108274", "answers": [{"text": "in stores, while others are offered only at Microsoft's online store.", "answer_start": 528}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Microsoft may be a relative newcomer to in-store retailing, but it's getting the hang of this Black Friday thing.

One law requires women to undergo an ultrasound examination and listen to a description of what it shows before getting an abortion.      Senate President Pro Tempore Glenn Coffee, a Republican, said Tuesday's vote shows lawmakers listened to Oklahoma's residents and \"made a bold statement in support of the sanctity of life.\" But Democratic Gov. Brad Henry has called the legislation \"an unconstitutional attempt by the Oklahoma legislature to insert government into the private lives and decisions of its citizens.\"      Henry vetoed the bill and another abortion-related measure Friday, but the state House on Monday overwhelmingly voted to override both vetoes, with House Speaker Chris Benge, a Republican, lauding his colleagues for moving quickly. The Senate's 36-12 vote Tuesday was the final step required to make the bills laws      \"Those who rallied behind this cause reflected the core values of Oklahoma citizens, and I applaud my colleagues in providing more safeguards for the life of the unborn,\" Coffee said.      Henry said he was disappointed by Tuesday's vote.      \"It signals the beginning of another costly and possibly futile legal battle for the state of Oklahoma. Both laws will be challenged and, in all likelihood, overturned by the courts as unconstitutional,\" he said. \"I fear this entire exercise will ultimately be a waste of taxpayers' time and money.\"      In a statement issued after his vetoes Friday, Henry sharply criticized the laws.      \"State policymakers should never mandate that a citizen be forced to undergo any medical procedure against his or her will, especially when such a procedure could cause physical or mental trauma,\" Henry said. \"To do so amounts to an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.\"      Henry said one of the flaws of the ultrasound bill was that it lacked an exemption for rape and incest victims.      Henry vetoed similar legislation in 2008. His veto was overridden. The State Supreme Court struck down the legislation because it contained multiple subjects, a violation of the state Constitution requiring measures to deal with a single subject, Bennett said.      The Center for Reproductive Rights said it had filed a lawsuit challenging the new law after Tuesday's Senate vote.      \"Oklahoma has now passed the most burdensome ultrasound law in the country,\" Nancy Northup, the organization's president, told CNN. \"Until Oklahoma stops harassing women who are seeking abortions, we will continue to sue the state on these unconstitutional restrictions.\"      Coffee said challenging the new laws in court would go against what Oklahoma residents want.      \"The voice of the people has spoken twice now this session in the Senate and twice in the House, and I sincerely hope those who would reverse the people's voice would think twice before acting,\" he said.      The other measure approved by legislators Tuesday prohibits pregnant women and their families from seeking legal damages if physicians \"knowingly and negligently\" withhold key information or provide inaccurate information about their pregnancies.      Henry, in opposing the bill, said it would be \"unconscionable to grant a physician legal protection to mislead or misinform a pregnant woman in an effort to impose his or her personal beliefs on his patient.\"      Such an issue would be particularly relevant to fetuses with disabilities.      \"By prohibiting recovery of damages in wrongful birth and life malpractice actions, the legislation would allow unscrupulous, reckless or negligent physicians to knowingly withhold information or negligently provide inaccurate information to pregnant women without facing the potential of legal consequences,\" the governor said.      The House voted to override the veto of the ultrasound bill by an 81 to 14 vote, well above the three-fourths majority required. State Rep. Lisa Billy, a Republican, said the bill \"does nothing more than give women as much information as possible before they make the life-altering decision to have an abortion.\"      \"I don't want a single woman to go through the lifelong torture of having an abortion without having all the relevant information,\" Billy said.      The House voted 84 to 12 to override the veto over the legal damages prohibition. State Rep. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said the bill \"simply states that a doctor cannot be sued based on the opinion after birth that a child would have been better off if he or she had been aborted.\"      \"A bipartisan coalition of members supported this bill the first time, and I am pleased they did again today,\" Sullivan said.      Benge, the House speaker, said, \"We must move to stop the degradation of human life seen in recent years and stand up for those who cannot defend themselves.\"      CNN's Joe Sterling and Catherine E.

Troy Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail.    The inmate, Troy Davis, has gained international support for his long-standing claim that he did not murder a Savannah police officer nearly two decades ago.    Justice John Paul Stevens on Monday ordered a federal judge to \"receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at trial clearly establishes petitioner's innocence.\"    Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer supported the decision. Sonia Sotomayor, who was sworn in August 8 as the newest member of the high court, did not take part in the petition.    Davis' case has had a dramatic series of ups and downs in the past year. He was granted a stay of execution by the Supreme Court two hours before he was to be put to death last fall.    A month later, the justices reversed course and allowed the execution to proceed, but a federal appeals court then issued another stay.    The high court's latest ruling means Davis will continue to sit on death row.    Stevens said the risk of putting a potentially innocent man to death \"provides adequate justification\" for another evidentiary hearing.    His supporters in June delivered petitions bearing about 60,000 signatures to Chatham County, Georgia, District Attorney Larry Chisolm, calling for a new trial. Chisolm is the county's first African-American district attorney. Davis is also African-American.    Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail. Witnesses said Davis, then 19, and two others were harassing a homeless man in a Burger King restaurant parking lot when the off-duty officer arrived to help the man. Witnesses testified at trial that Davis then shot MacPhail twice and fled.    But since his 1991 conviction, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony. No physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of the policeman.    The Georgia Pardons and Parole Board last year held closed-door hearings and reinterviewed the witnesses and Davis himself. The panel decided against clemency.    MacPhail's mother, Annaliese, told CNN at the time, \"This is what we were hoping for, and I hope pretty soon that we will have some peace and start our life, especially my grandchildren -- my grandson and granddaughter. It has overshadowed their lives.\"    After the justices in October refused to grant a stay of execution, Davis' sister, Martina Correia, told CNN she was \"disgusted\" by the decision.    \"It doesn't make any sense,\" she said. \"We are praying for a miracle or some kind of intervention. We will regroup and fight. We will never stop fighting. We just can't be discouraged. The fight is not over till it's over.\"    Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas objected to the court's decision Monday, calling it a \"fool's errand.\"    \"Petitioner's claim is a sure loser,\" wrote Scalia. \"Transferring his petition to the [federal] District Court is a confusing exercise that can serve no purpose except to delay the state's execution of its lawful criminal judgment.\"    Ten days after the high court refused last October to intervene, a federal appeals court in Georgia granted a temporary stay of execution. Since then, further appeals by Davis' legal team have dragged on for nearly a year.    Prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group Indigo Girls have asked Georgia to grant Davis a new trial. Other supporters include celebrities Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte; world leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu; and former and current U.S. lawmakers Bob Barr, Carol Moseley Braun and John Lewis."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/ce60e601346cec5610389a7d3d6604175df003a0.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where they found the remains of the student Annie?", "id": "108280", "answers": [{"text": "Yale medical research building", "answer_start": 944}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)  -- A quiet rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" capped an emotional candlelight vigil Monday night for slain Yale University student Annie Le, whose body was found on what was to have been her wedding day.    Students at Yale attend a candlelight vigil for Annie Le Monday night.    Several hundred people turned out on the Yale campus for the vigil, crying and hugging each other. Le's roommate, Natalie Powers, said the 24-year-old graduate student in pharmacology \"was as good a human being as you'd ever hope to meet.\"    \"She was also really tenacious and had a sense of humor that was never far away, and she was tougher than you'd think by just looking at her,\" Powers said.    \"That this horrible tragedy happened at all is incomprehensible. But that it happened to her I think is infinitely more so. It seems completely senseless.\"    Connecticut state medical examiners announced Monday that the body found in a Yale medical research building over the weekend was that of Le, who had been missing for nearly a week. Her body was found Sunday hidden in a basement wall. Bloody clothes were found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling elsewhere in the same building, investigators said.    Le was last seen entering the building Tuesday morning.    Thomas Kaplan, editor-in-chief of the Yale Daily News, said Le \"really had everything going for her.\"    \"She was a top scholar. She was very outgoing, a warm person,\" Kaplan said. \"You know, she was diminutive in stature, but certainly not in personality. And that's what I think just makes this so sad for everyone, regardless of whether you knew her. It's just a tragedy.\"    Le's death is being investigated as a homicide, but Connecticut medical examiners released no further information beyond the identification.    A candlelight vigil in her honor was scheduled for Monday evening on the campus.    A Yale professor said on Monday that the building has good security and only certain people can enter, let alone access certain areas. Professor Gary Rudnick, who interviewed Le when she applied for admission to the graduate program in pharmacology, said it gives him the sense that there could be a \"murderer among us.\"    No suspects are in custody, but investigators are questioning several people in the case, New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery said.  Watch a report about the case \u00bb    Kaplan said Le's killing has left Yale students shocked and wary. \"Only Yalies had access to that basement, and that seems to point to someone in our community being involved in this,\" Kaplan said. \"That's what is so frightening.\"    Authorities have not described the clothes that were found, nor said to whom they may have belonged. Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the blood-stained clothes.    Kaplan said a Yale police official told the newspaper the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building.    At a meeting Monday for members of the campus community, Yale officials discussed security and provided an update on the investigation. A faculty member and a student who attended the meeting told CNN that Yale officials said police have narrowed down suspects.    Security cameras captured video of Le as she entered the four-story lab building at 10 Amistad Street, about 10 blocks from the main campus, six days ago. After poring over hours of surveillance tapes, authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building.    Rudnick described security in the building as \"very good.\" It had restricted access, and simply having a Yale ID card was not enough to get in, he said. Within the building, one had to have special access to enter certain areas, he said.    Le was to be married Sunday on New York's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at Columbia University.    \"Annie has been planning this wedding for over a year with John, and she was very excited. She's been doing a countdown to her wedding day,\" Jennifer Simpson, a friend in Sacramento, told the CBS \"Early\" show. \"She was doing weather patterns to make sure that the weather would be perfect on her wedding day. She just wanted everything to be perfect, everything down to table napkins, to flowers. Annie was very, very excited about this day.\"    Investigators searched a waste facility Sunday that normally handles garbage from the Yale lab, said William Reiner of the FBI's New Haven office. The search took place at the Resources Recovery Authority landfill in Hartford, near New Haven.    \"In a situation like this, it's common for us to follow the trash,\" Reiner said.    Yale University President Richard Levin, in a statement to the campus community, said, \"Our hearts go out to Annie Le's family, fianc\u00e9 and friends.\"    The school sent out information Monday from Vice President and Secretary Linda Lorimer saying, \"We are cooperating in all possible ways with the police to ensure they find every shred of physical evidence in the building so they can solve this horrible crime without delay. When the building does reopen, there will be extra security both inside and outside the facility for the foreseeable future.\"    Lorimer added, \"To augment the substantial security already in place at the Medical School, Yale moved last week to increase security and police patrols on the streets in the area and to add a new bicycle patrol. Yale also added security personnel inside Sterling Hall of Medicine, where Annie Le had her lab.\"    The school has made grief counselors available, as well as a 24-hour help line number. \"The university chaplain's office is available to offer pastoral counseling and can put members of the community in contact with those of many faiths and denominations,\" the message from Lorimer said.    Le, a resident of Placerville, California, seemed to have been well aware of the risks of crime in a university town.    In February, she compared crime and safety at Yale to other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine, published by the medical school.    Among the tips she offered: Keep a minimum amount on your person.    And she practiced what she preached, Simpson told the \"Early\" show.    \"Annie always made sure she was safe,\" Simpson said. \"She doesn't walk around at night by herself. If she had to work late, she would make sure someone could come pick her up or walk with her.\"    When she walked over to the research building on Tuesday, she left her purse, credit cards and cell phone in her office.    Vanessa Flores, Le's former roommate, wondered whether the magazine article had something to do with Le's death.    \"The only thing I can possibly think of right now is maybe a psychopath, an antisocial person who -- I don't know -- maybe got upset about what she wrote about back in February about not being safe, and just kind of wanted to prove her wrong.\"    Le, originally from California, graduated from Union Mine High School in 2003, where she was named \"Best of the Best,\" and \"Most Likely To Be The Next Einstein.\"    \"She was very smart, well-rounded, liked by peers and very involved in school,\"  high school principal Tony DeVille told CNN affiliate WFSB.    Le set the bar high for herself, writing in her profile for the National Institutes of Health that she was interested in studying and researching regenerative medicine and hoped to remain working at at NIH or become a professor.    Her friends remembered her as one of the nicest people they had ever met.    Laurel Griffeath, a high school friend, told NBC's \"Today\" show in Le had a beaming personality matched with impressive intelligence, a girl who \"had it all.\"    \"Annie was just an amazing person, and I know that when tragedies happen, people always say that, but she truly was,\" Griffeath told the \"Today\" show. \"She was probably the most brilliant person I've ever met in my life, but what made her more amazing was that there was an intersection of intelligence and personality and ability and she worked hard and she was great with people and she cared about people and she was funny and she didn't sacrifice one part of her life for another like a lot of people kind of seem to.    \"She just really kind of had it all. She was really amazing.\"    CNN's Susan Candiotti, Mary Snow and LaNeice Collins contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/8b558e3e4136d0c7a53153a9baa73be0dc89dc1a.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who found some Mexican artifacts?", "id": "108282", "answers": [{"text": "Nick DiMola", "answer_start": 54}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- One man's trash is another man's mystery.    Nick DiMola holds what he believes are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts from Mexico.    Five years ago, Nick DiMola's rubbish removal company was hired to clean out a Manhattan apartment following the death of the owner, abstract artist Clinton Hill. The contents of a barrel that DiMola salvaged from the trash then has today raised a series of questions.    What DiMola holds are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts that he thinks are from Mexico, dating to between 300 B.C. and 500 A.D.    The mystery, which the Mexican Consulate in New York is trying to solve, is twofold: How much are the artifacts worth? And, if authentic, whom do they belong to?    DiMola first saw the collection of pottery and figurines while cleaning Hill's apartment in 2004. He stored the barrel in his warehouse instead of disposing of it, then promptly forgot about it.    Last week, DiMola rediscovered the pieces, only this time he told the New York Daily News about what he had found, announcing that he would sell them. That caught the attention of the Mexican government, which is studying the origins of the items and has claimed them.    Now, DiMola wants to donate his find, but not necessarily to Mexico, he told CNN.    The Queens native was excited about his discovery when he allowed representatives from the Mexican Cultural Institute to examine and photograph nearly all the pieces, DiMola said.    His curiosity about them was growing, and he was expecting an appraisal from the government officials. What he got instead was a heads-up about a possible petition to return the entire collection to Mexico.    \"My reaction is that that is not very diplomatic,\" DiMola said. \"It's a blow to the jaw.\"    Ruben Beltran, Mexico's consul general in New York, was not available for comment Tuesday. However in an interview with the U.S.-based Spanish-language TV network Telemundo, he said that if the pieces are part of Mexican culture, the government will try to get them back.    But as of now, no one is certain what the pieces are.    Howard Nowes, an ancient art dealer who does appraisals, examined a handful of the pieces that DiMola holds.    Nowes told CNN he saw a mix of authentic and non-authentic pre-Columbian pieces, which he valued at $3,000.    The pieces were broken and weren't very artistic, he said, adding \"from what I can see, it was mostly junk.\"    Unfazed, DiMola thinks all the pieces probably are worth more than $16,000 total, he said.    \"Something like this, you can't put a price on, because I may have a figure that no one has seen before,\" DiMola said. \"There's a big value in these pieces.\"    The Mexican government isn't taking any chances, and is conducting its own research into the authenticity and significance of the pieces.    Museums in Houston, Texas; San Francisco, California and Washington, D.C., have expressed interest in the pieces as well, DiMola said.    He said he'd like to donate the artifacts to museums across the country, and some to the Mexican Cultural Institute at the Mexican Consulate in New York City, but that could change if Mexico uses international law to claim the items.    The foundation that hired DiMola to clean the house is unlikely to try to reclaim the pieces, said John Koegel, the attorney who handled Hill's estate.    When Hill died, he left all his possessions to his lifelong partner, Allen Tran, Koegel told CNN.    In turn, Tran bequeathed all of Hill's possessions to a foundation \"to carry out his artistic legacy,\" he said.    Hill had some pieces from Mexico in his apartment that were cataloged, but the artist had no strong connection to the country, Koegel said.    For DiMola, all the fuss stems from a simple truth.    \"Sometimes you find things that are good and salvageable in the trash,\" he said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/90c9beec88f4baadd5ab1a61cfc3de8bed55c78e.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What remains a threat?", "id": "108283", "answers": [{"text": "the rain and flood", "answer_start": 395}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Half a million homes remained without power across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic region on Sunday, as rain continued to pound states from West Virginia to Connecticut for a second day.

Friends on Thursday described the fallen Scouts as multitalented, dedicated teens whose enthusiasm for life was matched only by their passion for Scouting.  Aaron Eilerts' best friend described him as a \"kindhearted\" person who took his commitment to Boy Scouts very seriously.  \"He would do anything that you asked him to do,\" Colby Gochanour, told CNN's Larry King. \"He just helped people.\"  As a member of the Humboldt Boy Scout Troop No. 108 in Eagle Grove, Iowa, Aaron used his own money to make pillowcases for hospital patients, Gochanour said.  He tried to donate the pillowcases to hospitals during a family vacation to Memphis, where he visited the home of Elvis, one of his heroes, according to a story that was published in the Eagle Grove Eagle last year.  Aaron extended the same dedication to making fleece blankets for the Humane Society, according to the Omaha World-Herald.  \"He embodied everything Scouting stands for,\" Dawn Sievertsen, principal of Robert Blue Middle School in Eagle Grove, Iowa, told the newspaper. \"He would start these projects to earn badges, but took them very seriously and would continue them long after he earned the badge.\"  People who knew Josh Fennen of Omaha said he used many of the skills he learned in Scouting in everyday life.  \"We'd go hiking.

Estemirova, pictured in 2007, had been openly critical of Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov.    Natalya Estemirova, of the Russian human rights group Memorial, was kidnapped outside her home in Grozny, Chechnya, Oleg Orlov said, citing eyewitness reports.    She was later found dead in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia, said Orlov, the head of the organization's Moscow office.    Estemirova, 50, was a leading human rights activist in the North Caucasus area who had been openly criticizing Chechnya's authoritarian president, Ramzan Kadyrov, and his methods.    Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed indignation at the murder and said her killers should be punished to the full extent of the law, his office said.    He expressed his condolences to her family, press secretary Natalya Timakova said.    Estemirova shouted that she was being kidnapped as she was forced into a white Lada automobile that had stopped on the road in front of her house at 8:30 a.m. (12:30 a.m. ET), Orlov said.    An unidentified man grabbed her and shoved her into the car, he told CNN. \"This is a kidnapping,\" she yelled, he said.    Estemirova studied history at Grozny University, then taught history before turning to journalism and human rights in 1998, Memorial said.    She joined the organization in March 2000.    In a written statement, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the United States is \"deeply saddened\" by the report of Estemirova's death.    \"We call upon the Russian government to bring those responsible to justice,\" he said.    He described Estemirova as \"uncompromising in her willingness to reveal the truth regardless of where that might lead.

Accidents and deaths are being linked to these problems.      This is prime political theater. Angry lawmakers are aggressively demanding answers, dressing down their corporate counterparts. Toyota officials are largely apologetic. Toyota President Akio Toyoda wept after the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing Wednesday.      What's largely occluded from television cameras, however, are the long, deep ties between Toyota, former federal government employees and current lawmakers, some of whom are (or have been) tasked with providing oversight, upholding public safety and, at the moment, potentially recommending regulatory changes.      Of course, ties do not mean tepid congressional questioning, nor do they mean tough regulations will not result from committee hearings. But as consumers -- and citizens -- watch the hearings transpire, it's worth remembering that Washington is a place where the public interest isn't always politicians' first or only interest.      In 2009, Toyota employed 31 lobbyists, hired to exert influence and defend the company's interests before Congress, the White House and federal agencies, such as the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy.      So who are these Toyota lobbyists working the back channels of government?      Our research indicates that in many instances, they're former members of the U.S. government, earning handsome salaries lobbying on behalf of their corporate client.      Among the leaders in this small army of lobbyists (and registered as such in 2009) are a former congressman, two former chiefs of staff for prominent senator currently serving, a former Department of Energy assistant secretary, a former assistant director of the National Commission on Air Quality and a former special events director for the Republican National Committee.      This is a group that can't be easily dismissed by congressional leaders and their staffs.      In politics, just like any social realm, it's simpler to say \"no\" to a stranger than someone who used to work for you or with you, or someone you may have even campaigned for. Now, in Toyota's period of political peril, the company will probably need the help of its lobbyists to mitigate damage to its corporate interests.      By December, Toyota had spent about $5.4 million on federal lobbying efforts for 2009, more than Honda, Volkswagen, Nissan or any other foreign automaker.      During the past five years, Toyota's federal lobbying expenditures total nearly $25 million, about enough to buy two new Prius hybrids for every member of Congress.      Among automakers, only General Motors and Ford have each spent more money to lobby the federal government during that time.      As for lawmakers themselves, they, too, have connections to Toyota.      In 2008, the most recent year for which data are available, seven members of Congress reported owning Toyota stock. Rep. Jane Harman, D-California, who represents that district in which Toyota's U.S. headquarters is located, declared in her 2008 personal financial disclosure report that she and her husband owned $315,000 in Toyota assets.      Harman, who serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating Toyota, said this week that she'd recuse herself from committee proceedings and votes, an appropriate step to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest.      No other member of Congress has publicly followed suit, including Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, another Toyota stock owner in 2008 who also sits on the committee.      Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, doesn't own Toyota stock, but he was instrumental in wooing Toyota to build a factory in his state, once saying he \"felt like a full-fledged member\" of Toyota's site selection team.      Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, is slated to serve as the Senate's lead investigator into Toyota's safety issues (hearings begin next week) and whether the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration properly monitored safety concerns about the company.      The agency's new chief? He's David L. Strickland, a former lawyer and senior staff member for Rockefeller's Senate committee.      (A spokeswoman for Rockefeller told the Washington Post this week that the senator fought \"for good-paying manufacturing jobs but never shirks from holding those same companies' feet to the fire when it comes to safety and consumer protection.\")      Lawmakers are also the beneficiaries of money Toyota has directly donated to their political campaigns. Although Toyota itself cannot create a political action committee through which to make donations to politicians -- foreign firms are banned from doing so -- the U.S.-based Toyota distributor, Gulf States Toyota, faces no such restriction.      Gulf States Toyota's political action committee has contributed at least $1,000 to each of 10 federal political candidates this election cycle after making donations to 29 federal candidates during the 2008 election cycle.      Included on this list -- for 2007 and 2008 -- are members of the congressional committees investigating Toyota: Reps. Joe Barton, R-Texas; Gene Green, D-Texas; Charles Melancon, D-Louisiana; Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana; and John Sullivan, R-Oklahoma.      Since 1999, Toyota employees in the United States have also individually donated more than $100,000 to congressional members.      Taken separately, these associations may not amount to a smoking gun of profit and politics over people.      But together, they represent a ruck of entanglements and potential conflicts of interest that must be adequately checked by the press. And the public must be mindful of these ties, lest they deliver on their potential to render safety subservient to a financial bottom line.

Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency.    \"Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,\" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday.    \"This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,\" he said.    There has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken.    The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.    The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.    In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds.    Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula.    It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years.    The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea.    \"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,\" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. \"They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had.\"    Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict.    \"This is a critical moment in the conflict when the space for these people has shrunk,\" Elder said.    The United Nations is \"calling on the ... Tamil Tigers to meet their international responsibilities and guarantee that these very large civilian populations to move freely and then can move away from the conflict and to areas where they can receive appropriate assistance,\" Elder said.    \"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,\" he said in a Sunday interview. \"Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need.\"    Sri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place.    Amnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that \"over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides.\"    The organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict.    \"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,\" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday.    The Sri Lankan authorities \"are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,\" she said.    At least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement.    Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/c8f52e0014cf48e62557a8142a240ee665010111.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was BP's claim?", "id": "108293", "answers": [{"text": "that no underwater oil plumes have formed because of the Gulf of Mexico spill.", "answer_start": 108}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Rep.

She steps into the role as swine flu numbers climb worldwide. As of Tuesday morning, at least 90 cases had been confirmed, including 50 in the United States.      Until her confirmation, the White House, which declared a public health emergency Sunday, was dealing with its first crisis without a secretary.

The Kansas governor came under fire for her ties to Dr. George Tiller, a late-term abortion provider.      Tiller and his staff attended a 2007 reception Sebelius held at the governor's mansion in Topeka.      Sebelius originally failed to account for donations she received from the doctor.      Sebelius also revealed in March that she recently paid nearly $8,000 in back taxes and interest. She said she had errors in her 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax returns.      Sebelius, 60, is the daughter of former Ohio Gov. John Gilligan, who led that state from 1971 to 1975. A two-term Democratic governor in a Republican-leaning state, she previously served as a state insurance commissioner and oversaw Kansas' Medicaid program.      She has been credited with boosting health care assistance for the poor during her tenure. A number of leading social conservatives have criticized Sebelius for her record on abortion, citing, among other things, her veto as governor of legislation that would have tightened abortion regulations in Kansas.      In vetoing the measure last April, Sebelius wrote that the bill was problematic because it included no exceptions for pregnancies that endanger a woman's life and it allowed individuals to seek court orders preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even if the procedure was necessary to save her life.      Some Republicans, however, have strongly defended Sebelius. Former Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, also from Kansas, testified on Sebelius' behalf in March, arguing that her record had proven her ability to work in a bipartisan manner. \"Sebelius' strength is that she understands health care [and is] willing and able ... to bring parties together in very critical areas,\" he said.      Kansas GOP Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback, as well as Republican Govs. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah commended her selection.      Former Sen.

In Las Tunas, students in boarding schools were sent home, because the schools will be used as shelters.    Evacuations were under way in some coastal areas prone to flooding.

Amnesty International activists protest human trafficking during an event in Greece in March.    The department's annual \"Trafficking in Persons Report\" found increased allegations of forced labor made in connection with a variety of agricultural products and manufactured goods in developing countries.    In Brazil, the report found a \"trafficking phenomenon.\" It said thousands of trafficked and forced laborers had been found on plantations growing sugar cane for Brazil's booming production and export of the biofuel ethanol.    The report cites shrimp processed in Thailand and Bangladesh; clothing from Bangladesh, India, Jordan and Malaysia; and bricks made in India, China and Pakistan as being among the products of booming industries in which workers are subjected to forced labor, debt bondage and hazardous working conditions. Laws are not adequate to punish those responsible, it adds.    China was found to have a \"significant\" problem with forced labor, including forced child labor. Children as young as 12 are reportedly subject to forced labor under the guise of \"work and study programs\" and subject to excessively long hours, dangerous conditions, low pay and physical abuse. The report found China's growing brick industry is fraught with cover-ups of the problem.    For the fourth year in a row, China was put on a \"watch list\" of countries that could face sanctions if they don't improve their efforts to combat trafficking.    India was also placed on the watch list for not doing enough to solve its trafficking problem, according to the report. While commercial sexual exploitation remained a problem in India, the State Department found internal forced labor \"may constitute India's largest trafficking problem.\" It said men, women and children are forced to work in brick kilns, rice mills, agricultural businesses and embroidery factories.    Once again, the report found U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf to have dismal records on trafficking.    Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman were listed as destination countries with widespread trafficking abuses. The report cites forced laborers trafficked from Asia and Africa who are subject to restrictions on movement, withholding of passports, threats, and physical and sexual abuse. The report found those countries made weak efforts to rescue the workers and prosecute the traffickers.    The other countries on the blacklist are Algeria, Myanmar, Cuba, Fiji, Iran, Moldova, North Korea, Papua New Guinea, Sudan and Syria."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/37e6037b28ff5c517ab64e586f86babd725650a1.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What event is she attending?", "id": "108303", "answers": [{"text": "the unveiling of a new statue of President Reagan", "answer_start": 1776}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House did not intend to show any disrespect toward Nancy Reagan when it failed to invite the former first lady -- a vigorous supporter of stem-cell research -- to a bill-signing ceremony on the subject, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday.

Extra! Read all about it!\" -- barked out by battalions of newsboys hawking newspapers -- died decades ago, a casualty of home delivery, mass distribution and the advent of coin-operated newspaper machines.    Some coin-operated newspaper machines have lasted for 30 years, but lack of sales may force their retirement.    But now as newspapers across the country wage a battle to survive in a market where readers are increasingly gravitating to the Internet for information, the fate of another industry fixture seems inevitable. Could those steel machines on street corners, distributing newspapers since the '50s, be headed for the scrap pile?    To begin to answer the question, all it takes is an early morning visit with a man who feeds those machines.    It's 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, and a white delivery truck for the New Jersey Record has just pulled into the parking lot outside the Plaza Diner in Fort Lee, New Jersey.    The driver -- Mike, who asked that his last name not be used -- is at one of his 130 stops on an eight-hour shift that began at midnight. Mike's job, which takes less than a couple of minutes per stop, entails filling the coin-operated machine with the day's papers, collecting unsold copies and emptying the machine of its coins.    Even though Mike has a full schedule and lots of stops, it doesn't equate to pushing as many papers as he once did. Mike loads 15 copies of the Record into one machine -- and that's a good load, he says. Other locations receive only five to seven copies. He's also tasked with filling machines for USA Today.    Though he's been on this job for only two years, Mike has been on the route long enough to know business is down. He says newspapers sell better at train stations than from the street machines he services.    The demise of newspapers across the country is getting a lot of front-page headlines. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer in Washington was just one of the most recent victims, ceasing print publication in March as declining circulation and plummeting advertising sales forced it to retrench and become just an online provider of journalism.    Even the legendary New York Times will force readers to dig deeper for more coins as it raises prices June 1, with the price of a paper going from $1.50 to $2.    The publication that touts \"All The News That's Fit to Print\" has been relying less on newspaper racks. In 1999, the Times had 13,300 vending machines, but today that number has shrunk to 5,678, according to Diane McNulty, spokeswoman for the Times.    \"One of the factors is home delivery,\" McNulty said, adding, \"This was due to our national expansion -- where once many readers could only get copies from the newsstand or vending machine, they can now enjoy home delivery service.\"    But all the gloom-and-doom predictions that newspapers will one day disappear isn't scaring workers at the Kaspar Sho-Rack Company, based in Shiner, Texas. The company lays claim to being the world's largest manufacturer of coin-operated and no-charge newspaper vending machines.    Don Kaspar is president and a fourth-generation member of a family business that began in 1898 manufacturing wire products.    \"There'll be printed newspapers for years and years\" said Kaspar, president of a company that is actually part of the larger Kaspar Wireworks. Still, he concedes, \"Business is down about 25 to 30 percent from about five years ago.\"    It wasn't until the late 1950s that the privately owned company was approached by the now defunct San Antonio Light newspaper to develop an early version of coin-operated newspaper machines.    The early versions of newspaper machines were simple and made mostly of wire, but by the mid-1960s they were all made of metal.    The machines typically consist of a thick metal housing, shelves, doors and hinges. But the heart of any machine is the coin mechanism, which can have 150 moving parts, according to the manufacturer. Some advanced models introduced in 1999 feature lithium batteries to run the coin-collecting mechanism.    Often weighing around 100 pounds, these hand-assembled machines cost on average $450 each, with refurbished models selling for around $300, the company says.    The zenith of the company's business may have been the 1980s, when the introduction of USA Today landed it a contract to build and deliver 100,000 coin-operated machines. Today only 65,000 machines populate the nation's sidewalks, according to a USA Today spokesperson.    In 1985, Sho-Rack sold its 1 millionth newspaper machine and it has sold several hundred thousand since. Its biggest clients have been the giants of newspaper publishing, including Gannett, Tribune, Newhouse and the McClatchy newspaper groups.    But the fate of those publishers directly affects the bottom line at Sho-Rack.    \"Business now? It's certainly slowed down,\" said Kaspar. \"Free publication racks ... we've stayed fairly busy with those. Coin- operated machines? Newspapers are cutting costs and pulling a lot of the racks from outlying areas. As a result this causes a surplus number of racks and then ultimately less of a need for new racks from us.\"    Though the coin-operated machine business makes up 25 percent of the parent company's overall business, Sho-Rack has learned to diversify and adapt.    \"We're not dependent on any one industry,\" Kaspar said.    The company, which employs nearly 500 workers and occupies more than 500,000 square feet in a small rural town, also manufactures thousands of wire, tubing and sheet metal products.    The average life span of a coin-operated newspaper machine depends on several factors.    Some machines, even with modest refurbishments every couple of years, have lasted for 30 years. For others it can be five minutes after an encounter with a snowplow.    For the Kaspar Sho-Rack Company, as long as newspapers are printed and sold, its machines will gladly continue to accept coins."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/5a2be0b97b4814a447be7102982e53ed3843fa01.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many mobile phones are produces in China?", "id": "108310", "answers": [{"text": "750 million", "answer_start": 1164}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "SHENZHEN, China (CNN) -- The white BMW Mr. Liu drives around this humid coastal city in southern China may be real, but the spiffy little black smart phone he carries with him is definitely fake.    Phone clones: China's \"bandit\" mobile phone market is huge.    \"But it has Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, FM radio, a digital video camera, hundreds of games, even a voice recorder,\" says Liu. \"And I invested over $500,000 to make it.\"    Liu, a 31-year-old who studied fine arts in college and designs cigarette cartons on the side, is one of countless thousands here who've earned big bucks manufacturing \"gray market\" mobile phones, millions of which are not only being sold across China but also exported to dozens of developing countries in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and other regions around the world.    \"They are everywhere,\" said Karl Weaver, a wireless evangelist and mobile device specialist for the Chinese handset ecosystem. \"You can find them in major department stores and malls, in back alleys and in underground markets. Everyone is selling them. It is really very entrepreneurial.\"    In 2008, an estimated 150 million, or 20 percent, of the 750 million handsets produced in China were either counterfeit or off-brand phones, according to CCID Consulting, a market research firm based in Beijing. Of those, over 51 million were sold in China while the remainder were sent to foreign markets.    Known here as \"shanzhai ji\", or bandit phones, China's gray market handset industry was virtually non-existent just a few years ago. While a handful of illegal companies produced black market mobiles, they often were of poor quality mainly because the technology needed to make them was hard to come by and even harder to master.    This all changed in 2005 when Mediatek, a microchip design company from Taiwan, developed what experts call a turnkey solution -- a platform that integrated many complex mobile phone software systems onto a single chip. This made it much easier and cheaper to build handsets and churn out new models at astounding speeds.    \"[Mediatek] basically commoditized the entire market,\" said Jonathan Li, founder of Shanghai-based technology design studio Asentio Design. \"They made it really simple and really cheap to make your own phone. Almost anybody could do it.\"    The shanzhai business got another boost a couple of years later when the Chinese government relaxed regulations limiting the number of companies that could manufacture handsets, lowering the entry barrier for hundreds of entrepreneurs eager to have a piece of the world's biggest mobile phone market.    \"It is so easy to do because this whole ecosystem is in China,\" said Weaver. \"It isn't so complex for a guy to figure out by watching how the global supply chain works in the mobile handset space to do his own thing.\"    Small operations, big rewards    By 2008, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 shanzhai businesses had emerged, many with fewer than a dozen employees operating in offices sometimes comprised only of a back bedroom in a small apartment or basement of a private home. Some blatantly copy major brands, producing knock-offs with slight twists in their names, others come up with special makes of their own.    Either way, the shanzhai phenomenon has not gone unnoticed by legitimate handset manufacturers. The gray market phones, which typically sell for around $100, have already driven down the prices of brand name mobiles and are beginning to take away their market share, too.    \"You cannot compete with them. You can't,\" said an employee of Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"It is almost impossible to make a profit [from handsets] now because of shanzhai.\"    Some manufacturers, like Nokia, say they are working with the Chinese government to crackdown on the counterfeiting companies as well as raise awareness about the potential dangers of the fake phones, some of which have had exploding batteries or expose consumers to abnormal amounts of radiation.    \"We have a very good working relationship with the Chinese authorities,\" Lucy Nichols, Nokia's global director of intellectual property rights and brand protection, told CNN. \"They recognize this is an issue that needs to be addressed.\"    Aside from also trying to highlight the risks of using shanzhai mobile phones, Beijing has yet to take serious steps to curtail the proliferation of the underground mobile phone industry.    Some experts say this is because the companies involved in it blur the boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. Even though they may still partake in shady practices, such as evading taxes, avoiding safety checks and using pirated software, a growing number of bandit phone firms are becoming licensed, creating brands with nearly as much recognition as established domestic ones.    And whether licensed or not, nearly all the grey market firms place orders with mobile phone component companies that work with major manufacturers as well, which keeps factories up and running especially as handset sales plummet amidst the economic downturn.    Not just faking it    Many shanzhai companies have begun to move beyond mere copying and into the realm of creativity. Some have been developed to suit the needs of the local market, with two slots for SIM cards for businesspeople traveling between Taiwan, Hong Kong and the mainland.  View the gallery of the phones \u00bb    Some have gimmicky appearances, like cigarettes boxes or watches, but others have special lights that can be used to identify fake money, large screens and keypads for the elderly or extra loud speakers for farmers who may not be able to hear their phones while working outside.    \"This is an important way to cultivate grassroots innovation,\" said Jack Linchuan Qiu, a communications professor at Chinese University of Hong Kong who has studied the shanzhai industry.    \"There is a lot of raw power in the development of these bandit phones that could be channeled into normal, productive creativity from the bottom up.\"    Fierce competition among bandit phone firms continues to drive prices down while prices for more advanced technology continues to go up, causing many of the companies to close simply because they can't make the margins they did a couple of years ago.    Thousands of shanzhai companies have disappeared in recent months or have moved into new areas of opportunity, making shanzhai laptops and digital cameras.    Mr. Liu is now planning his exit strategy, too. He says he is not sure what he'll do next, but whatever it is, he hopes it will involve making lots of money. \"I am trying to realize a big dream,\" he said. \"But every success has a shortcut.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/5bcd4e61b39cc7ffff38ad88cd40afa208b18528.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what involves Pojamarn's 2003 purchase of some prime Bangkok real estate?", "id": "108312", "answers": [{"text": "stock concealment plan", "answer_start": 706}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- The wife of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra arrived in Thailand Tuesday morning to face corruption charges, promising to fight the accusations, her attorney said.

Lucky strike: The port city of Cape Town is set to benefit from several major sporting events    The Indian Premier League cricket tournament was recently relocated to South Africa because of security concerns, and now Cape Town is slated to host the opening match on April 18.    Both the Lions Tour rugby and the FIFA Confederations Cup football will follow the cricket tournament, heading down to South Africa later this year.    Combined with the arrival of the World Cup in 2010, South Africa has suddenly become the ultimate holiday spot for sports fans.    Calvyn Gilfellan, chief executive of Cape Town Routes Unlimited -- the region's tourism board -- told CNN the boost to the region had arrived at a crucial time.    \"When the financial crisis started people went into gloom and doom but these events are helping a lot to restore confidence in the industry.    \"The fact that we have a positive exchange rate also helps us a lot as a destination,\" he said.    But South Africa's government is so focused on ensuring the success of the upcoming games that it recently denied a visa to The Dalai Lama.    Critics contend that South Africa bowed to pressure from the Chinese government in refusing Tibet's spiritual leader entry to attend a peace conference that was partially intended to help promote the World Cup.    As the focus strengthens on these international events, the Cape Town region looks set to benefit more than many from the expected surge in tourism.    Gilfellan says this is largely due to the city's location.    \"We are lucky to be in such a wonderful spot. A lot of these events revolve around the marine industry and revolve around the harbor.\"    This weekend harbor will play host to the Cape Town International Jazz Festival -- one of many upcoming festivals in the area.    Cape Town's picturesque Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, set against the backdrop of Table Mountain, has become South Africa's most visited tourist attraction.    Commodore of the Royal Cape Yacht Club (RCYC) John Martin, told CNN the Cape Town port was used widely for business, leisure and sports.    As well as being the country's second biggest functioning port for trade, the port played host to racing yachts in events such as the Volvo Ocean Race and the Clipper Round-the-world Challenge.    \"We have several major yachting events that stop here and we are very proud of that.\"    Martin said the popularity of the port means water space is \"at a premium,\" but there are hopes a new harbor and breakwater will be constructed in the next few years.    Still, Cape Town has the capacity to cater for foreign visitors on super-yachts and international cruise-liners.    \"Cape Town is a real focal point for refueling and repairs and it's also quite cheap here so people tend to stay for a while,\" he said.    Gilfellan said she felt the surge of massive sporting events would undoubtedly have spin-off benefits for the marine industry.    The Indian Premier League Twenty20 cricket, which starts this month, had been tipped to go to England, but ultimately South Africa was chosen for its sunny weather. The tournament, which will feature 59 matches across six venues, will run from 18 April to 24 May    The 2009 British and Irish Lions tour officially kicks off on May 30 in Rustenberg. Matches will be held in Cape Town on June 13 and June 23.    The eight-team Confederations Cup runs from June 14-28, and will take place across four cities. The event marks the first time an African nation will host an international FIFA tournament.    The landmark event foreshadows the much-anticipated World Cup football tournament in June 2010, for which qualifying matches are currently being held.    Although that's still a year away -- there are signs that the excitement in South Africa is already palpable.    A new television commercial that began airing last month features Spain and Liverpool star, Fernando Torres, and Brazilian icon Kaka showing off their football skills.    The advertisement ends with Torres saying \"Ke Nako\", which in South Africa's Sotho language means \"it's time.\"    It seems for Cape Town and the whole country -- this could not be more true.

Congressional critics, meanwhile, lambasted the agency and called for an independent investigation.    \"Undoubtedly, this raises potential security concerns across our transportation system,\" House Homeland Security Chairman Rep.

Consider the numbers: it's the world's most populous nation (1.3 billion), where more than 100 cities have populations over a million. Fifty-six ethnic groups are spread across 22 wildly distinct provinces and five autonomous regions, in a landmass slightly larger than the U.S.    The Tiananmen Gate at the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing    Its history seems limitless and its traditions just as deep. But here and now, change is the only real constant -- and it is accelerating at a dizzying pace. (One thousand new cars hit the streets of Beijing every day.)    How do you begin to fathom a country of such extremes? The futuristic cities glittering above timeworn villages; the great rivers and vast empty deserts; the radical new architecture juxtaposed with millennia-old monuments; the ceaseless push-and-pull between Confucianism, Communism, and commerce. Where do you even begin? Have no fear. Start here with Travel + Leisure's suggestions for where to go and what to see.    Beijing: 2--3 days    China's political, historical and cultural capital demands at least three days -- for the familiar landmarks of Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and also for Beijing's 21st-century architecture, such as the \"Bird's Nest\" Olympic National Stadium by Herzog & de Meuron and the glass-and-titanium dome that is the National Grand Theater. China's contemporary art scene finds its nexus in the galleries and caf\u00e9s of the Dashanzi Art District, home to the new Ullens Center for Contemporary Art. Travel+Leisure.com: Tips for flying to China    Beijing's atmospheric hutong, or traditional alleyways, are fast disappearing; explore the bustling ones off Nanluoguxiang, near the 13th-century Drum and Bell towers. Then check out the Legation Quarter, a high-end restaurant, entertainment and cultural development set within the former American Embassy compound. And save a morning to stroll the manicured, 660-acre grounds of the Temple of Heaven, site of the circular Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, the 15th-century apogee of Chinese ritual architecture. Travel+Leisure.com: Chinese taxi trips    The Great Wall    Numerous stretches of the Great Wall are easily accessible from Beijing (ask your hotel to arrange a car or bus tour). But avoid the tourist trap of Badaling and head to the slightly less trammeled Mutianyu section, a 90-minute drive northeast of the Forbidden City. Early morning is best; try Asia 1 on 1 for day trips. Travel+Leisure.com: Where to stay in China    Shanghai: 2--3 days    First stop: the riverfront promenade known as the Bund, with its Art Deco, Neoclassical, and Beaux-Arts fa\u00e7ades, bars and shops, and views of the space-age towers of Pudong. In People's Park you'll find the Shanghai Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Weekdays are the best time to wander among the pine trees and ponds of the 16th-century Yuyuan Gardens.    Xintiandi was the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party; now this restored two-block district is defined by upscale shops and restaurants. The leafy, rustic French Concession is the favored destination for cutting-edge fashion and designs for the home. Shanghai's latest secret? Lane 248, a gritty, narrow street now inhabited by artsy caf\u00e9s and intimate boutiques, hidden behind Taikang Road. Travel+Leisure.com: China shopping tips and strategies    Guilin: 2 days    (Two hours by air from Shanghai.) With its sheer limestone peaks jutting up from the Li River, Guilin is straight out of a traditional Chinese landscape painting, and remains one of China's most breathtaking sights. Take in the view from Solitary Beauty Peak and marvel at the formations of the Reed Flute Cave. Spring and fall are best; avoid the heat of July and the crowds of the holiday seasons.    Xi'an: 2 days    (Two hours by air from Beijing.) China's ancestral capital is renowned for its \"terra-cotta army,\" created during the Qin dynasty (221--207 B.C.): thousands of life-size clay warriors stand in formation as part of the funerary complex of China's first emperor, with much more yet to be excavated. You'll need at least two days here to take in the warriors, see the Shang dynasty bronze relics at the Shaanxi History Museum, walk along the Old City walls, and visit the Da Mai market.    Datong: 2 days    (One hour by air or six hours by scenic train ride from Beijing.) Majestic Qing dynasty frescoes are the standout in the celebrated temple district. Nearby excursions include the awesome Buddhist sculptures in the Yungang Grottoes and the Hanging Temple of Mount Hengshan, which clings precipitously to the side of a cliff. Not far away are some especially beautiful eroded mud-brick ruins of the Great Wall.    Hangzhou: 2 days    (Two hours by bullet train from Shanghai.) Fabled West Lake is the major draw here, with its elegant causeways, pavilions, gardens, and arched bridges. Hangzhou is also renowned as a culinary capital: local specialties include stuffed-beggar's chicken and fatty dongpo pork; sample both at the great Louwailou restaurant. Travel+Leisure.com: Must-try Chinese food    Suzhou: 1 day    (45 minutes by train from Shanghai.) Famous for its Ming- and Qing-dynasty gardens (don't miss the Garden of the Master of the Nets and the Humble Administrator's Garden), Suzhou was once called the Venice of the East for its canals. But smart travelers know the most picturesque waterways -- fringed by whitewashed houses and 1,000-year-old humpbacked bridges -- are in the village of Tongli, a 50-minute drive away.    Kunming: 1 day    (Three hours by air from Shanghai.) This city is one of China's most pleasant, in climate-blessed Yunnan province. Visit the 15th-century Bamboo Temple and the 17th-century Golden Temple, stroll the pavilions and bridges of Green Lake, and savor the raucous energy of the Kundu Night Market.    Dali: 1 day    (45 minutes by air from Kunming.) Like nearby Lijiang, Dali has a strong ethnic-minority flavor, a walled Old City with cobblestoned streets, and striking mountain scenery -- but without the same tourist mobs. Explore on foot, peek at the Three Pagodas, or go for a boat ride on Erhai Lake.    Taiyuan: 1 day    (One hour by air from Beijing.) The capital of Shanxi province, Taiyuan is home to the Shanxi Provincial Museum, offering a superb survey of the region's 5,000-year history, and the Jinci Temple weaves a thread between Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism. And 90 minutes southwest by car is Pingyao, a stunningly preserved walled city and veritable time machine that carries you back to the Ming and Qing dynasties.    Planning a beach getaway?

I'm saving the planet for your kids and your grandkids,\" says the performer, who has starred in award-winning one-man shows on Broadway and appeared in dozens of films and TV shows.      Biking gets you places faster, reduces your carbon footprint, lowers noise, makes you fit and lowers your stress level -- unless you get impaled on the door of a suddenly opened cab or cut off by a guy from New Jersey.      Leguizamo thinks urban biking is a form of transportation that dramatically improves the environment and riders' physical and mental health.      New York City's government shares Leguizamo's enthusiasm about biking, having added 200 miles of bike lanes in the past three years. The city says it has seen a 45 percent increase in commuting by bike.      Leguizamo took CNN on a tour of his favorite biking spots and shared his thoughts about the best way to get anywhere fast in the nation's biggest city:      CNN: How long have you been biking?      Leguizamo: I started biking when I was 7 years old, and I've been biking in Manhattan ever since I got that first bike.      I grew up in Queens. Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, Astoria, Corona, I started going to high school in Manhattan when I was 15, and I moved to Manhattan when I started going to NYU. In high school, on the weekends I would bike to Central Park over the 59th Street bridge. Very Paul Simon and Garfunkel.      At NYU, my bike was stolen. The pole I locked it to was a fake pole, and I came back and the pole was gone. I thought at first that I had chained my bike on a different block, but then I realized there was a hole in the concrete.      CNN: Why should people bike?      Leguizamo: There are a lot of great reasons. First of all, we all want to lower our carbon footprint, and this is one of the great ways, reduce pollution, reduce traffic, reduce noise pollution, improve your heart with reduced stress. When you're out there, it makes you friendlier. You get a little bike rage, but that's only when people cross you. I usually get to places with a lot of great energy and a lot more relaxed.      I just saw this old good lady, she must have been in her late 60s, and she had like an adult tricycle, and she had her guitar in the back and a loud horn, and she was smiling and biking down Fifth Avenue. It was great. And for a lot of people who can't run, biking is a lot less stress on your knees.      CNN: What are the biggest risks of biking in New York City?      Leguizamo: Kamikaze cabs, buses, tourists, people from New Jersey. A Jersey plate will always try to cut you off for sure. And you know Miami and Connecticut plates are always going to go way slow, but that's not as dangerous. And then the crazy pedestrian that comes out between two big vans that block the view, that jump out. There's more danger for them than for you, but you don't want to hurt nobody, either.      Opening the door on the street side, my God, that's the most dangerous: passengers opening up the street door instead of the curb door. That should be taught in school. That should be part of your SATs.      It's amazing too the amount of cursing you hear from drivers, bikers, cabbies. You learn to curse in every language.      CNN: How can you get started biking?      Leguizamo: Start slowly in parks until you get maximum skill, and then start taking less busy streets. Just go slow. Don't try to race. If you go slow, you will learn all the urban tactics that you need for biking in Manhattan. You will learn that people are going to do the craziest things. People are going to cut you off. Expect the unexpected at every second.      You gotta look for potholes, doors swinging, pedestrians. It's a massive amount of focus. But the fact that you survive and you're home, you feel incredible. And it's so great. It relieves so much stress. I always lose weight. It keeps my cardio up, too. Every time I get tested, they say, \"You have the heart of a 20-year old.\" They're not talking about my liver.      CNN: What about the equipment you need?      Leguizamo: Get a recycled bicycle, recycle a bicycle, you know, something old and beat up. If you can't and you're too high-maintenance, get something really fancy and wreck it. Get sandpaper and a screwdriver, and you got to mess it up. Because if it looks shiny and nice, no matter what massive lock you have, somebody's going to cut it. If you recycle a bicycle, you get the cheapest lock, and you don't have to carry that massive chain that will weigh you down.      You got to have some rain fenders, some rain guards, or then you can only bike and be messy. You can't bike in your suit as much if it rains. And if you're going to ride at night, you've got to have lights, either on your bike or your helmet. I like it on the helmet because people can really see you. And get a front light and a back light.      And you need something for the hem of your pants. Either tuck them in your sock or get one of those little pant grips. When I don't pay attention, my jeans have gotten caught many times on the chain.      Wear elbow pads, wrist guards, a Kevlar vest. It's Manhattan. Although we're not the murder capital any more. Is it Philadelphia? Or Arkansas?      CNN: What about the tourists who come to New York? Should they try biking at all?      Leguizamo: No, not in Manhattan. You have to know what you're doing. You can bike on the West Side Highway. That's good for kids and tourists. In Manhattan, you need to know the terrain. You gotta be alert and know what those signs of danger are. If you're a tourist, you're going to be looking at the Empire State Building. \"Look at how big and beautiful all those Art Deco buildings are.\"      All of a sudden: Pow.

Around 20 billion euros of the total amount will be spent over the next 12 months.

The final 4 billion euros will be spent on improving France's transport, energy and postal service infrastructure.

Eurostar, which operates trains between Britain and France, announced it was canceling up to 50 percent of services Friday as bad weather caused a repeat of problems that led to major disruptions and long lines of frustrated and angry travelers last month.      With satellite images showing the UK covered in snow from top to toe -- a rare modern event in a country that has experienced two decades of relatively mild winters -- authorities lacking snow plows and salt supplies were struggling to clear roads.      Britain's weather forecasting Met Office is warning of continued icy conditions, drifting snow, severe frosts and dangerous wind chill factors across the country over the coming weekend, blaming the recent cold snap on freezing northerly blasts from the Arctic.      It said icy conditions were expected to continue for the next two weeks. Forecasters were warning of similar conditions in France, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, the Czech Republic and parts of Italy in the days ahead.      As temperatures plummeted to 30-year-lows of -22.3 Celsius (-8.1 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the UK, gas suppliers were reassuring users that there was no immediate likelihood that interruptions to fuel imposed on some businesses could spread to households.      The National Grid, which handles supplies of natural gas across Britain, reported that is was expecting to cope with all-time record demand levels Friday after similar peaks a day earlier that called on 454 million cubic meters of gas.      Despite the high demand -- and technical problems affecting gas flow from Norway -- National Grid spokeswoman Stephanie van Rosse said there was no danger of an interruption to supply.      \"We've got plenty coming in,\" she told CNN. \"It's just a matter of balancing it.\"      One of the companies whose gas was switched off was British Sugar, based in Peterborough, 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of London. A spokesman there told CNN they had simply switched to using oil until the gas comes back on.      \"It doesn't affect our production, so it's just business as usual,\" said the spokesman, who asked not to be named. \"It's a bit of a non-story, really. We just switch and it's no big problem.\"      Main airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton, were continuing to advise passengers to contact airlines before setting out as weather added to disruptions already caused by increased security in the wake of last month's failed U.S. plane bombing.      Cold weather, blamed for 22 deaths countrywide, also shut schools across Britain and led to warnings of hazardous roads as grit and salt supplies wore thin, prompting local authorities to impose rationing.      Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said Britain's only two suppliers of salt were operating at capacity as authorities' standard emergency provisions for six days of snowy weather ran dry.      \"The two salt producers are working flat-out, 24 hours-a-day, and we have ordered more salt supplies from abroad,\" he told the BBC.      \"But... we will face some difficult decisions about where we are going to prioritize gritting of roads in this exceptionally severe and prolonged cold weather.\"      CNN's Melissa Gray and Barry Neild contributed to this story"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/d326e081a3c568e3e6d74dd1a0644c274e220132.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who was second in poll?", "id": "108354", "answers": [{"text": "Eliot Spitzer", "answer_start": 650}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- A new national poll suggests Illinois Gov.

Fifty-six percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday said Blagojevich, who has been arrested on corruption charges, was the naughtiest politician in 2008.    Blagojevich, accused of attempting to sell President-elect Barack Obama's former Senate seat, has said he has done nothing wrong and plans to fight the allegations.    The poll also found 23 percent believed former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer should get the nod, followed by 19 percent for former presidential candidate John Edwards.    Spitzer resigned in March after it was revealed he was Client No. 9 in a high-end prostitution ring. In November, prosecutors announced they would not be bringing criminal charges against Spitzer.

Brazilian soldiers pour insecticide to fight dengue fever in 2008. Bolivia also is battling the mosquito-borne disease.    At least 12 unconfirmed instances of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported in the first 17 days of 2009, the official ABI news agency said.    About 250 cases of dengue fever, the milder, nonlethal form of the disease, have been confirmed in the past two weeks, said Health Minister Ramiro Tapia in the Los Tiempos de Cochabamba newspaper.    Authorities said they have committed more than 20,000 military personnel and 2.5 tons of insecticide to combat the disease.    A preteen boy died last week at Children's Hospital of La Paz, a few days after arriving with internal bleeding, hospital director Christian Fuentes told La Razon newspaper in La Paz, the nation's capital.    \"By that time, there was nothing we could do. He had multiple internal hemorrhages,\" Fuentes said.    A 17-year-old boy and a 30-year-old woman also died last week, the ABI news agency said, citing the national director of epidemiology, Juan Carlos Arraya.    Cases of dengue fever usually spike from November through January, which is Bolivia's hot and rainy season. Alberto Nogales, the country's vice minister of health, said the fight against mosquitoes will last until April.    Dengue occurs in tropical and subtropical parts of the world, transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of four dengue viruses, the World Health Organization says.    Symptoms, which appear three to 14 days after the bite, can include mild to high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain and a rash, the WHO says.    Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially fatal complication that affects mainly children, the WHO says. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and bleeding.    The disease cannot be transmitted directly from one person to another.    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are up to 100 million cases worldwide each year.    \"It actually is quite common,\" Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC told CNN last year. \"And unfortunately, over the last 30 years or so we've seen an increase in the number of countries infected with dengue fever.\"    Khan attributes the increase in part to population growth. Mosquitoes that carry dengue typically breed in areas near humans.    \"This is a disease that occurs where there's lots of population,\" he said.    The WHO says mosquitoes carrying dengue viruses breed in exposed water, including places as shallow as jars, discarded bottles and plant saucers.    Last year, 55,000 people in southeastern Brazil contracted the disease. The outbreak was confirmed as causing the deaths of at least 67 people -- almost half of them children under 13 -- and another 58 deaths were under investigation last summer, the Rio de Janeiro state's ministry of health reported at the time.

It is a question that has been asked frequently over the years, but recent comments from world number three Andy Murray, and former world number one Andy Roddick, have indicated the matter could be coming to a head.      With a schedule that runs from the beginning of January to the end of November, taking in 65 singles tournaments, the ATP World Tour came under scrutiny like never before when Murray hinted that the world's top players were prepared to take strike action in an attempt to modify the calendar.      \"We're only proposing small changes, a few less mandatory events and some more rest periods,\" said Murray. \"Tennis is in a great place right now but there are just a few minor things we'd like to see changed and we hope to sit with the ATP and other officials and discuss them. Two or three more weeks off a season is really what we are thinking of.\"      And Murray's comments were backed up by Roddick, who told reporters: \"It's a more physical game than it used to be, but the season is longer than ever.      \"I don't think we're storming offices, but I think the sentiment is still there. We need to be smart about it and take our time and make sure that it's well thought out and not be kind of reactionary. But, you know, there is a discussion going on.\"      The absence of Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic from the recent Shanghai Masters indicates, in Roddick's opinion, that the demands are too harsh on the top players. \"They don't get their money this week. If they were feeling well and they weren't worn down, then they would be here,\" he continued.      \"We're not getting away with anything by pulling out of tournaments. I feel like that's the way it's presented sometimes. That's just not the case,\" he added.      The lowdown      Yet, despite the claims of both Murray and Roddick, the facts show that the number of singles tournaments has actually fallen over the last 11 years.      In year 2000 there were 69 ATP Tour singles events, however, that figure steadily decreased during the last decade and since 2007 it has remained static on its current number.      And, for those 65 events, there has been a significant increase in the prize money on offer from the ATP Tour, with prize funds set to exceed $90 million for the first time by 2014.      So why are is there a perception that players are playing more tournaments, than ever before?      Somebody who knows all about the rigors of the ATP Tour is Australian Mark Woodforde. The 46-year-old won a remarkable 67 doubles titles, many alongside compatriot Todd Woodbridge, with the duo completing the grand slam of all four major doubles titles.      In addition to this, Woodforde also managed to win four singles titles, reaching a career-high 19th in the world in 1996, and has first hand knowledge of how demanding the circuit can be.      \"When I was playing and performing well in both singles and doubles, the calendar issue was raised even then,\" Woodforde told CNN. \"What with Davis Cup ties, the Olympics etc, you never felt like there was any time to take a breather, it was full on.      \"The weeks off were cherished. As an aspiring player, you play to gain experience -- and since you may not survive through to the end of a tournament, the toll is not as great on you physically or mentally. Losing first and second round matches can be replaced by simply entering another event to compensate,\" added Woodforde.      \"Yet as a top player, you end up playing many more matches, the pressures are greater, you try to strike a healthy balance to prepare for excellence at the grand slams and it's a continual mounting of pressures.\"      The reaction      Woodforde also believes it a positive thing that today's players are campaigning together, although he does not necessarily believe reducing the calendar is the way forward.      \"There is a fear that by shortening the calendar to accommodate players requests of resting at the end of each season -- their agents will slot exhibition matches in their place, which will be worth more financially to the player (and their agent!),\" Woodforde added.      \"Perhaps there should a total blackout of all exhibition matches for a period of say four weeks -- and if the players are in need of some competition, they can go back and play some club tennis.\"      Another former player, and now commentator, Andrew Castle also believes the schedule is fine as it is.      In his column in British newspaper Metro, Castle said: \"Players are obliged to play eight mandatory Masters 1000 tournaments, four 500 ATP events and the four majors, plus the World Tour Finals if they qualify.      \"With pre-grand slam events thrown in, we are looking at a commitment of 30-34 weeks of the year. I am looking at it and thinking there isn't a lot to moan about.      \"The players are under a lot of strain and the tour takes its toll -- but if your body is telling you something, listen to it and withdraw from the odd tournament.\"      The future      Since his initial comments, Murray has seemingly backtracked on any talk of strike action, telling reporters: \"When I said a strike was a possibility, I didn't expect that to be such a massive issue.      \"It's so far away from being at that level. None of the players want to strike and I think we are maybe coming across as being a bit spoiled when I don't think that is the case.\"      The ATP politely turned down CNN's request for an interview regarding a proposed players' meeting, although ATP Tour spokesman Simon Higson said: \"The players should and do have a major say in how the game is run, which is one of the key reasons the ATP Tour was formed as an equal partnership between players and tournaments.      \"We have regular discussions with the players, including very recently, and are always receptive to their input. It's important to let them have time to discuss and focus on which topics are most important to them and then we can work together on next steps and solutions.\"      Sporting strikes are not a new phenomena. In the last year alone there have been disputes in both Major League Baseball and NBA basketball in the United States, as well as the top soccer leagues in Spain and Italy, which have resulted in a cessation of play.      Whether such extreme measures will eventually happen in tennis would appear unlikely at this stage, but what is clear is that some high-profile players are unhappy with their work-load and unless administrators, players and sponsors alike are all singing from the same hymn sheet, the current rumbles of discontent could become louder and louder in the weeks and months ahead."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/5a1bec30205b6938392f3119366e27d15b4849e8.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "whar did stufflebeem do", "id": "108359", "answers": [{"text": "engaged in sexual relations in the White House in 1990 with a federal", "answer_start": 35}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Navy admiral engaged in sexual relations in the White House in 1990 with a federal employee whom he falsely told he was a widower, according to a report released Friday by the Defense Department.    Rear Adm. John Stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the Navy staff.    In March, when the report was submitted to Pentagon officials, Rear Adm. John Stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the Navy staff.    Stufflebeem told investigators he couldn't remember the name of the woman he had an affair with. He also lied when he told investigators he did not engage in sexual relations with the woman, identified as \"Jane Doe,\" the Defense Department's inspector general's report said.    Jane Doe, who was then unmarried and working for a federal agency, told the investigators the allegations were true, the report said. Her supervisor and Stufflebeem's superiors supported her testimony.    Stufflebeem was convicted April 18 of making false official statements to investigators. After the hearing, called an admiral's mast, he requested retirement.    Jane Doe told investigators that she and Stufflebeem began their affair on an overseas trip in 1989, that the married admiral told her he was a widower who was raising his children as a single parent and that they had sexual relations several times, including once in a White House room reserved for \"military aides with overnight duties.\"    She also told investigators that Stufflebeem came to her home on the day in August 1990 when she learned he was married and that she called him \"scum,\" shut the door in his face and never spoke to him again. Read the report (PDF)    \"We found Ms. Doe to be an extremely credible, candid and articulate witness who willingly participated in our interview with the knowledge and support of her husband,\" the report said.    By contrast, the report said, Stufflebeem's testimony was \"inconsistent with the weight of the evidence,\" and \"it did not appear Stufflebeem's misstatements in these areas of testimony were inadvertent.\"    At issue was Stufflebeem's removal from his post as a presidential aide in 1990. Stufflebeem testified that he initiated the request to leave his White House post because of \"close family personal problems.\" But his superiors testified that he was removed from the post because of his relationship with the woman -- and that he admitted the affair.    Jane Doe's supervisor told investigators that when she learned of the affair from Doe, she confirmed Stufflebeem's marital status and told Doe what she'd learned.    \"Ms. Doe's reaction, according to the supervisor, was one of complete surprise and shock,\" the report said.    The supervisor also said that she telephoned Stufflebeem's immediate supervisor to tell him of the affair and that when she called a few weeks later to follow up, the supervisor told her that \"everybody in town knew Boomer was f'ing some bimbo at the [federal agency].\"    Stufflebeem, however, denied to investigators that he had a sexual relationship with Jane Doe, although he admitted to one kiss and said he had an \"inappropriate relationship\" with her because he told her about his marital problems.    \"I did not have sex with this woman,\" he said during one of two interviews with investigators.    Although he told investigators he could not remember the woman's name, he testified that he \"had to live with shame for a long time\" after the \"inappropriate relationship\" ended, that he was \"racked with guilt\" and \"had a terrible time getting myself right with my family.\"    \"So I have had a great 18-year career since I left the White House,\" he said, according to the report. \"If this is the end of it, then I still leave a rewarded individual, thankful for the blessings that I have had.\"    Investigators found Stufflebeem's remarks inconsistent.    \"In our view, comments regarding guilt, shame, and the end of a distinguished naval career are incongruous with a physical relationship limited to one kiss,\" they wrote in the report.    This year, according to the report, the inspector general's office provided Stufflebeem with its preliminary findings: that he'd provided \"false and misleading testimony\" regarding the nature of his relationship with Jane Doe, his inability to recall her name and his representation to her of himself as a widower.    Stufflebeem responded with a vehement denial.    \"[I] find it extremely regrettable, in a case that has such far reaching implications for my career, that you have chosen to question my integrity,\" he wrote in a February 15 letter. \"The unfortunate truth in this case is that, as a result of lack of evidence to substantiate the allegation of a sexual relationship and in lieu of investigating the underlying allegations, you have chosen to accuse me of being untruthful as I defended myself against these allegations.\"    Stufflebeem further castigated the investigators because, at that time, they had chosen not to interview Jane Doe \"in deference to Ms. Doe's privacy,\" according to the report. Doe \"readily agreed\" to testify when they contacted her after Stufflebeem's rebuttal.    \"Ms. Doe confirmed that she and Stufflebeem had an extensive physical relationship which began on an overseas trip and lasted intermittently for approximately eight months,\" the investigators wrote. \"The relationship included sexual intercourse on approximately one dozen occasions, to include intercourse during overseas travel, in the White House and in her home.\"    Doe also said Stufflebeem told her that his wife had died of breast cancer, that a woman who answered the phone when she called his home was the children's nanny and that he continued to wear his wedding ring \"for his daughters who missed their late mother.\"    According to the report, the investigation began when investigators received an anonymous letter containing \"significant\" details about the affair. Investigators had received another such letter in 1999, but it contained no detail and was not investigated.    Stufflebeem became well known in the initial months of the war in Afghanistan, when he often conducted on-camera television briefings as a Pentagon spokesman. He was then deputy director for global operations on the Joint Staff.    He was commander of the 6th Fleet from May 2005 to September 2007. During that time, he was deputy commander of Naval Forces Europe, joint force maritime component commander in Europe, commander of strike and support forces for NATO, and allied commander with Joint Command Lisbon.

Hillary Clinton remains the person to beat, a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday suggests.  As the countdown begins to November 4, 2008, the New York Democrat continues to dominate the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the GOP front-runner, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  But Clinton's path to the White House is in no way certain. Clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week, and her rivals for the Democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on Iraq, Iran and other major issues.  The Republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the Democratic front-runner, with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping Clinton.  The attacks may be working. The CNN/Opinion Research polls suggests that Clinton's support has slipped from its height one month ago.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider on the latest poll numbers \u00bb  \"Clinton's strength is about where it was throughout the summer, indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that Obama has not yet cut into her core constituency,\" CNN political director Keating Holland said.  Clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters interviewed for the poll. Her closest rival, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, was the top choice of 25 percent, and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina has 14 percent.  All other Democratic candidates were in single digits. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was backed by 4 percent, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware by 3 percent, Sen. Christopher Dodd by 2 percent, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich by 2 percent and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel was at 1 percent.  The poll involved 467 interviews conducted on November 2-4 with Democrats or independents who lean Democratic. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.  View the poll results \u00bb  In an October CNN/Opinion Research poll, Clinton was supported by 51 percent of Democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over Obama.  During last week's Democratic debate, Clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow Democratic presidential rivals, who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the Iowa Caucus in early January.  Edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate, criticizing Clinton for her stance on Iraq, Iran and Social Security.  \"The American people ... deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth and won't say one thing one time and something different at a different time,\" Edwards said.  Edwards has also accused Clinton of being a \"corporate Democrat\" too willing to defend a \"corrupt\" Washington establishement.  \"We desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in Washington that's become broken, corruption has crept into it, and we have to tell the truth about that,\" Edwards said Monday. \"If you defend that system, I don't believe you can bring about the change that America needs.\"  In the Republican presidential race, Giuliani continues to be the leading candidate, with the backing of 28 percent of the Republican primary voters polled. Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee was backed by 19 percent. Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the top pick of 16 percent, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had 11 percent.  Of the remaining Republican candidates, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee received 10 percent, Texas Rep. Ron Paul 5 percent, California Rep. Duncan Hunter 4 percent and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo 3 percent.  The poll involved telephone interviews with 397 Republicans or independents who lean Republican. The poll's margin of error was 5 percentage points.  In a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners, Clinton leads Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent. That lead has increased since October, when Clinton led Giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent.  \"The overall political environment seems to favor the Democrats, partly because Democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood, which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party,\" Holland said.  Only 42 percent of Americans think things are going well, while 58 percent think things are going badly, the poll found.  \"The public is not just pessimistic about the country -- Americans are angry,\" Holland said.  \"More than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country.\"  Clinton's lead over Giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, the poll found. In a three-way race, Clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters, Giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent.  The poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent.  \"My analysis of it is that [a third-party candidate] is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me,\" Giuliani said. \"You know it is a tactic, and a legitimate one. People have to think about that and consider it.''  The lack of enthusiasm for Giuliani, particularly by social conservatives, could spell trouble for the GOP next year if he becomes the nominee, Holland said.  \"Only 27 percent of Republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if Giuliani won the GOP nod, and the remaining GOP candidates fare even worse,\" he said.

Ross said the bill unveiled Tuesday by House Democratic leaders did not address concerns he and other conservative Democrats outlined in a letter late last week to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.    The conservative Democrats don't believe the legislation contains sufficient reforms to control costs in the health care system and believe additional savings can be found.

The National Asset Management Agency, as the \"bad bank\" is officially known, will pay 8.5 billion euros ($11.4 billion) for the first 16 billion euros in debt, it said Tuesday.      The move takes 1,200 loans off the books of Irish Nationwide Building Society, EBS Building Society, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Anglo Irish Bank. The first two banks' debts were taken over on Monday and the other three institutions' bad loans should be transferred by early April, NAMA said.      Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan gave a sobering assessment of the banks' health Tuesday.      \"I understand why many want us to close\" Anglo Irish Bank, which lost huge sums in property lending, he told lawmakers. \"I understand the impulse to obliterate it from the system.\"      But, he said, \"the sums required to rescue the bank are enormous but the costs of winding it down are even greater.\"      The government has already replaced the management of the bank.

The Bank of Ireland \"expects to be able to raise private capital and is well advanced in its actions to address its capital needs,\" and EBS is in talks with \"a private party\" about raising market capital, he added.

South Korean Yoon Ki-Dal, right, meets the children he left behind as babies during the Korean War.    Yoon Ki-Dal, 88, of South Korea thought such a moment would never come. After leaving his son and daughters when they were babies during the Korean War, he was able to hold the hands of his North Korean children on Saturday.    \"Father, we thought you were dead,\" his daughter, now in her 60s, told him, her face trembling.    Their family was one of 97 reunited Saturday on Mount Keumgang, a North Korean resort near the eastern part of the border, after decades of separation by war and ideology.    And soon these families will be separated again. They are allowed to be together for a few days. Then the South Koreans must return home.    The reunions -- the first in nearly two years -- are taking place through October 1.    Millions of families were separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a cease-fire and no formal peace treaty. No mail, telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the Korean border.    The agreement to hold the reunions came after North and South Korea held three days of talks, mediated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, last month, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported at the time.    About 10,000 people applied to take part in the reunion, but fewer than 200 families were allowed to participate. In addition to the 97 families who met Saturday, another 99 families are expected to meet next week, authorities said.  Watch families share hugs, tears \u00bb    Participants are selected randomly, and there is no date set for a further reunion, which means the tens of thousands of others who were separated by the Korean War have no idea when they may get a chance to see their loved ones -- if ever.    For the many separated family members who are elderly, a reunion may never be possible.    Reunions between North and South have been taking place off and on since 2000 after an inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, Yonhap says. The last reunion took place in October 2007.    Rapprochement talks between the two Koreas have hit a wall since conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor, Roh Moo-Hyun.    The two Koreas have remained in conflict since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953.    Last month, officials from both sides had the first high-level, cross-border contact in nearly two years when South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon.    The meetings and reunions are in stark contrast to the tense public statements each side made about each other earlier this year.    Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan, also referred to as the East Sea. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters.    South Korea condemned the action, calling the launches \"unwise.\"    Journalist Sohn Jie-Ae contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/7ea6e7f324b4cd8acbf6e258ec53c621a8644b79.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What caused the decision?", "id": "108389", "answers": [{"text": "because of a September 2007 shooting incident", "answer_start": 334}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq will not grant an operating license to security firm Blackwater Worldwide, an Interior Ministry official said Thursday.

Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation.    The company does not face any charges. But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life.    The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA). The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services \"in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas.\"    A security agreement approved in December 2008 specifies U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in Iraq.    Iraq has required the licensing of private security companies since 2004, but the provision was not strictly enforced.    Last year, the State Department renewed Blackwater's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government.    Starting January 1, the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain licenses to operate.

A health care worker vaccinates a child during an earlier outbreak of meningitis in Niger.    The disease is an epidemic in 76 areas of the two countries, the health agency reported Wednesday.    A spokesman for W.H.O. in Nigeria, Dr. Olaokun Soyinka, said Saturday that the outbreak is bigger than usual and stretches across the African meningitis belt from east- to west-sub-Saharan Africa.    The outbreak began around the start of the year, Soyinka told CNN. It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust, winds and cold nights, before dipping around May when the rains come, he said.    A shortage of vaccines means officials are relying on \"effective prevention,\" in which they watch for outbreaks and then vaccinate people in the epicenter and surrounding areas, Soyinka told CNN.    There have been nearly 25,000 suspected cases and more than 1,500 deaths in the meningitis belt in the first 11 weeks of the year, W.H.O. reported. More than 85 percent of those cases happened in northern Nigeria and Niger.    Nigeria's Ministry of Health has reported 17,462 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 960 deaths, the world health agency said. In the past week, it reported 4,164 suspected cases with 171 deaths.    Sixty-six local government areas in Nigeria have crossed the epidemic threshold. Epidemic thresholds are a way the W.H.O. confirms the emergence of an epidemic so it can step up vaccinations and other management measures.    Niger's Ministry of Health has reported 4,513 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 169 deaths, since the start of the year. In the past week, 1,071 suspected cases and 30 deaths have been reported, the W.H.O. said.    Ten of Niger's 42 districts have crossed the epidemic threshold.    By comparison, other countries are reporting fewer than 50 cases a week.    Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis but Neisseria meningitidis -- which is to blame for this outbreak -- is one of the most significant because of its potential to cause epidemics.    Health authorities have released 2.3 million doses of vaccine to Nigeria and 1.9 million doses to Niger, the W.H.O. said.

Smokey Bear, the Ad Council's most famous icon, has moved from 1940s posters to his own Facebook page.    The \"Sesame Street\" stalwarts star in a series of public service announcements to teach children healthy habits in the face of the H1N1 flu virus.    The Muppet and the man (actor Roscoe Orman) are the latest in a long line of characters -- human and not -- to star in public service announcements co-sponsored by the Advertising Council.    The Ad Council, the charitable arm of the advertising industry, employs the same top-flight talent that creates ads for Budweiser, Coca-Cola and other familiar brands.  Watch Elmo and Gordon give the pitch \u00bb    Growing beyond its early \"Buy War Bonds\" posters and Smokey TV spots, today's Advertising Council is moving into social media \"in a very big way,\" said Peggy Conlon, the organization's CEO.    \"There's all kinds of ways the Advertising Council finds its target audience on the web,\" she said, noting that the group has its own YouTube channel.    A marketing executive endorses the approach.    \"If your target is young people, television really doesn't make a lot of sense now if they're spending hours on the Internet, hours in social media,\" said Ben Kunz, director of strategic planning for Mediassociates, a media planning and Internet strategy firm. \"You need to find a way to reach them in the media that they consume.\"    The \"holy grail\" is to go viral, as people pass the message around because they like it or think it's important, Kunz said. A gory, four-minute British PSA on the dangers of texting while driving has received nearly 600,000 views on YouTube in less than two weeks, fueled in part by Facebook and Twitter links.  Watch how the PSA has changed minds \u00bb    \"If you can leverage these new human networks using mobile and Facebook and Twitter and blogs to disseminate your message, that's the real home run,\" he said. \"But the only way to do that is to give people a real reason to become engaged.\"    One campaign that tries to do that is called Boost Up, aimed at encouraging students to complete high school.    Louis Caldera, who at the time was secretary of the Army, initiated the project with a call to the Ad Council because of a lack of qualified recruits.    \"There was a disconnect between the societal message that said, 'Go to college,' and [the Army's] message, which said, 'Don't go to college, join the military,'\" Caldera, a West Point alumnus, told CNN.    Caldera wanted people to think of the Army as a leader in education issues, not an alternative to schooling, and he sought the Ad Council's help.    \"We absolutely did not want people to think this was about recruiting,\" he said.    The council put together a campaign intended for all students, with a particular goal of reaching Latinos, for whom dropout rates are higher than for other groups.    \"It really encourages people -- both adults and their peers -- to give these kids the encouragement that they need to really reach within themselves and find the personal resolve that they need to overcome life's difficulties and graduate from high school,\" Conlon said. \"It's a really smart campaign. I think it's very genuine, and it resonates really well with kids.\"    Although dropout rates generally and among Latinos remain high, \"I think this is making a contribution to creating the environment in which more students can be successful,\" said Caldera, now a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank.    President Obama will appear in the latest series of Boost Up PSAs, to begin airing next week.    The Ad Council and its partners measure a campaign's success by how much donated media a campaign attracts. Media outlets will run an ad more if it helps them retain audiences, Conlon said. The Ad Council receives $1.8 billion a year in donated media, she said.  Watch some notable Ad Council PSAs \u00bb    The council also measures response to phone numbers or Web sites promoted in the ads and tracks awareness through before-and-after surveys, Conlon said.    \"We can watch the needle move over time,\" she said. \"It's very scientific; it's very empirical.\"    But not every campaign is a home run, Conlon admitted.    \"We kind of laugh about the Gerald Ford 'Whip Inflation Now' with his big WIN buttons,\" she said. \"The Advertising Council did that campaign, and for many reasons that were mostly cultural, it completely bombed.\"    And then there are those campaigns that get mixed reviews.    \"The 'Just Say No' campaign was probably the biggest success,\" Kunz said. \"I think it led to something like the creation of 5,000 clubs around the country, and there was a definite decline in drug use.\"    Conlon laughed.    \"It was a terrible campaign,\" she said. \"And the reason was not because we shouldn't be telling young people not to use drugs, but it's just not as simple as that. It stripped it down to such a simplistic message that it had terrible reaction on the part of kids.\"    Campaigns are about educating the public on the facts of an issue, Conlon said.    \"You have to get their attention, and that's where the creativity comes in,\" Conlon said. \"It can't be just lecturing or just exposing the message to people. In this cluttered media environment, you really have to have something that breaks through.\"    One creative spot that has broken through on an emotional level depicts a grown man practicing cheerleading moves on a sidewalk. The humorous ad promotes fathers' involvement in their children's lives.    \"Being a good dad sometimes requires shamelessness,\" said Bill Ludwig, creative director at the Campbell Ewald ad agency in Detroit, Michigan, which created the spot. \"The idea is that the smallest moments can have the biggest impact on a child's life. Just spend a little time with your kid.\"    The father-daughter message touched Facebook user Jessica Gonzales, a graduate student in San Diego, California.    \"There's plenty of ads telling us what to buy, how to look, etc., but few remind us how to just be ... and how to be good to one another,\" Gonzales said. \"The ad's tagline is 'Take time to be a dad,' but that message could be easily translated to so many other roles: Take time to be a friend, a mentor, a positive influence.\"    That's the kind of response the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is hoping to get from co-sponsoring the \"Sesame Street\" flu campaign.    \"We are doing everything we can to protect public health and teach children how they can stay healthy and safe,\" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. \"Elmo, Gordon, Sesame Workshop and the Ad Council are delivering an important message to our kids.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/1e9e31930c9e0306fea27edb17909f5395656109.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does SEGA say about the affected service?", "id": "108395", "answers": [{"text": "it is investigating the cyber break-in.", "answer_start": 853}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Tokyo (CNN) -- Hackers have stolen personal information from over 1.2 million customers of the Japanese gaming company SEGA, according to a company statement.

Part of a collapsed ConAgra Foods plant lies atop parked cars Tuesday in Garner, North Carolina.    Four people were in critical condition after the explosion at the ConAgra Foods plant in the town of Garner, CNN affiliate WRAL-TV reported.    The explosion, reported about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, caused sections of the roof to collapse. Search efforts for those missing were slowed by ammonia leaks and a fire that was not extinguished until afternoon.    \"There was no warnings, no signs,\" Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said. \"It all happened very abruptly.\"    At least 38 people were transported to area hospitals, said Jeff Hammerstein, district chief for Wake County Emergency Medical Services.    Four burn victims -- two males and two females -- were undergoing critical care at the North Carolina Jaycees Burn Center, said Dr. Charles Cairns, director of emergency medicine for UNC Hospitals. The patients suffered burns that covered from 40 to 60 percent of their bodies, Cairns said.    Police said recovery workers still were trying to get the two bodies out of the plant, which makes Slim Jim food products. The victims' names weren't immediately available.    More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said. The cause of the blast was unknown, according to Garner police spokesman Joe Binns.    Rescuers were crawling into the rubble -- sometimes in pockets of space less than 30 inches tall -- in attempts to access the two bodies and find the missing person, officials said at a news conference Tuesday night.    The search crews were moving slowly in part because the building is very unstable, officials said.    Video from the scene showed holes in sections of the roof of the 425,000 square-foot plant. First responders set up a makeshift triage area near the building. A section of the roof was collapsed, and pipes could be seen spewing liquid believed to be ammonia.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio supervises an inmate relocation in Phoenix, Arizona.    Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff's department have had an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security since 2007 that allows his department to enforce federal immigration laws. But Arpaio says the federal agency is moving to revise the agreement to limit that power to checking the immigration status of inmates already in his Phoenix jail.    Arpaio has cultivated his image as \"America's Toughest Sheriff,\" a nickname earned by his treatment of Maricopa County inmates. Many of his prisoners are housed in tents and forced to wear pink underwear, and he once boasted of feeding them on less than a dollar a day.    Now he faces a Justice Department investigation into allegations of civil rights abuses, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona is suing the sheriff over immigration raids conducted by his department.

French soldiers patrol in Afghanistan in May 2008.    French and NATO authorities confirmed the deaths and said 21 other soldiers were wounded in the fighting in the Sarobi area in Kabul province, about 30 miles northeast of the capital.    The clashes began late Monday afternoon and continued into Tuesday, when the casualties occurred, French officials said.    French President Nicolas Sarkozy said his \"determination is intact\" to continue \"this battle against terrorism for democracy and liberty.\"    \"The cause is just. It is an honor for France and its armies to defend them,\" said Sarkozy, who will travel Tuesday night to Afghanistan, the Defense Ministry said.    Last month, nine U.S. soldiers were killed in fighting in eastern Afghanistan.    U.S., British, Canadian and Dutch troops have been engaged in much of the combat in Afghanistan. The United States has been urging other countries in the NATO-led alliance to help ease the burdens of those troops on the front lines.    About 1,670 French troops serve in Afghanistan under NATO's International Security Assistance Force, according to ISAF's Web site. Before this incident, a total of 12 French troops had died in several incidents during the Afghan war, mostly in combat.    As for the latest fighting, NATO said the initial patrol -- which included Afghan forces -- had been \"reinforced with quick reaction forces, close air support and mobile medical teams.\" It said \"a large number of insurgents were killed.\"    Gen. Zahir Azimi, an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman, said Tuesday that Afghan army forces rushed to the battle scene soon after the attack took place.    He said 27 militants were killed and 14 were wounded in the fighting, and 13 of the bodies were recovered by the Afghan army. He said one of the dead militants was identified as a Pakistani national.    The Taliban posted a Web statement saying its forces attacked an \"American\" convoy, killing 20 soldiers and destroying five military tanks. It also said foreign forces later Tuesday bombarded the region and killed five Taliban militants and several civilians.    The fighting came after authorities tightened security on Monday in anticipation of militant attacks on the country's Independence Day.    Several suicide bombers struck an American base about 12 miles from the border with Pakistan in Khost province on Tuesday, but U.S. and Afghan forces repelled the onslaught.    Seven insurgents were killed in the attack on Forward Operating Base Salerno, including three suicide bombers who blew themselves up after forces from the base encountered them more than 3,000 feet from the base, ISAF said in a statement.    U.S. and Afghan troops noticed the approaching militants by their \"special behavior,\" the spokesman said. Helicopters flew in to attack them, the force said.    ISAF said it suffered no casualties.    Gov. Arsallah Jamal of Khost province said four commandos -- presumably Afghans -- were wounded when the militants struck late Monday.    A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said 15 suicide bombers with small arms and machine guns entered the base and inflicted heavy casualties -- claims that the NATO-led force and Khost governor dismissed.    That attack came after a suicide car bombing outside the same base killed 10 Afghan civilians and wounded 13 others Monday, the U.S. military said. Two other would-be bombers were killed before they could carry out attacks, Jamal said.    Afghan forces stopped a second would-be car bomb near the base, performed a controlled detonation and detained a suspect, the NATO-led force said.    This comes as a source from the Afghan Defense Ministry, who declined to be named, confirmed that Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani arrived in Kabul on Tuesday morning to meet with Afghan and NATO military officials.    In southern Afghanistan, a suicide bomber struck a Canadian foot patrol on Tuesday in the Kandahar province district of Panjwayee, local police said.    The bomber and an Afghan interpreter for NATO forces were killed and a NATO soldier and a child were wounded, police said.    The attack occurred as troops chatted with villagers in the district's main bazaar. The Taliban, in a Web statement, said 11 foreign soldiers were killed or wounded in the attack.

May 1 is traditionally a rallying day for supporters of immigration reform. But protesters across the country said they were galvanized by Arizona's recent passage of a law cracking down on illegal immigration.      The new Arizona law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they are in the United States illegally. Critics say it will lead to discrimination and racial profiling.      But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has said the law is necessary because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico, allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to move into the state. She said changes to the law she approved Friday, which clarify that police could only stop suspected illegal immigrants while enforcing some other law or ordinance, should eliminate concerns about racial profiling.      But criticism of the law was clear among tens of thousands of protesters flooding the streets of Los Angeles on Saturday, where organizers said they hoped to send a strong message with the number of people turning out.      \"Does my face look illegal?\" one sign read.      Karen Rayner, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said 50,000 people marched at the demonstration's peak. Rayner said the rally was \"very peaceful\" and no one was arrested.      Police arrested about 20 protesters -- including a U.S. congressman -- at Saturday's rally in Washington.      Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, was among a group of protesters who were arrested for blocking the sidewalk outside the White House in what they said was a planned act of civil disobedience. The protesters wore T-shirts that read \"ARREST ME NOT MY FAMILY\" and \"ARREST ME NOT MY FRIENDS.\"      A smaller group of about 200 people rallied outside the State Capitol in Phoenix, protesting the new law and asking the federal government to step in to stop it.      About 1,000 people gathered in New York City's Union Square on Saturday afternoon.      Cesar Mack, an international studies student at City College of New York, told CNN he was an undocumented immigrant from Peru.      \"I've been living in this country six years and I'm still fighting for immigration reform,\" he said.

John Coleman quit his band after it suspended him for nodding to President Obama last week.  John Coleman resigned from the Cleveland Firefighters Memorial Pipes & Drums a week after the parade in Washington. Publicity about his suspension had gotten to be too much, he told CNN affiliate WEWS.  \"It's come to a point where I don't want embarrassment anymore between the pipe band and myself,\" Coleman, who is a firefighter, told WEWS on Tuesday.  Coleman was seen during the nationally televised January 20 parade nodding toward the new president while marching with the band. A few steps later, he appeared to wave briefly.  He told WEWS that as the band was marching past the grandstand where Obama was sitting, he made eye contact with the president.  \"Contact was made with our eyes both together and he smiled and waved at the band,\" he told the station. \"And just as a gesture, I nodded my head. I gave him a slight wave and went on.\"  Watch parade and explanation \u00bb  Representatives from the group did not return calls from CNN. But bandleader Mike Engle told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that Coleman was suspended because he ignored military protocol.  \"We had gone over and over time and again with everyone in the band that this was a military parade,\" Engle told the newspaper. \"Protocol and proper decorum had to be followed at all times. Unfortunately, John chose to ignore that.\"  Coleman had been suspended from the band for six months.  In a written statement, band manager Ken Rybka said Coleman's resignation from the group \"comes as a shock and surprise.\"  The band has been inundated with phone calls, e-mails and messages on its Internet pages -- almost all of them critical -- since the story first broke on Monday, Rybka said. iReport.com: 'Pretty cool thing that he acknowledged the president'  \"It is unfortunate that an internal band issue has raised so much discussion and ire from the general public,\" Rybka said in the statement. \"It has disheartened me more than you can imagine.\"  Rybka said that he will be taking a leave of absence from the band because of the furor.  \"The 'afterglow' of participating in the inaugural parade is gone,\" he said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/e0ddf766661004eb3ff337d95e249073410f0755.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who was banned?", "id": "108417", "answers": [{"text": "Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali", "answer_start": 38}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "ROME, Italy -- Italian tennis players Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali have been banned by the ATP for betting on matches.    Top Italian player Potito Starace has been suspended for six weeks for betting on matches.    The country's top player Starace -- 31st in the ATP rankings -- has been suspended for six weeks from January 1 and fined $30,000 (20,890 euros) for making five bets totalling around 90 euros two years ago.    Bracciali, world ranked 258, has been banned for three months and fined $20,000 (13,930 euros) for making around 50 five-euro bets between 2004 and 2005.    The Italian Tennis Federation (FIT) confirmed the news on its website, www.federtennis.it. However, they denounced the penalties as disproportionate, saying the players never bet on their own matches.    \"Injustice is done,\" the statement said. \"These penalties are absolutely, excessively severe compared to the magnitude of the violations carried out by the two players.\"    The federation said the two were not aware of the ATP's betting regulations, and that they stopped placing the bets as soon as they learned it was against the rules.    Another Italian player, Alessio Di Mauro, became the first player sanctioned under the ATP's new anti-corruption rules when he received a nine-month ban in November, also for betting on matches.    Starace and Bracciali said they were scapegoats for a larger match-fixing scandal.\"It's disgusting,\" said the 26-year-old Starace. \"The ATP doesn't know where to turn. It's all a joke.\"    Bracciali said the two had been \"sacrificed.\"    \"That's why they came after us,\" the 29-year-old said. \"We are not champions and we don't count in the upper echelons.\"    ATP officials could not be reached for comment on Saturday.    Concerns about match-fixing have risen since August, when an online betting company reported unusual betting patterns during a match between fourth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina. The company, Betfair, voided all bets and the ATP has been investigating.    Davydenko, who retired while trailing in the third set, denies wrongdoing.    Since then, several players have said that they had been approached with offers to fix matches in exchange for money.

But this is not a scene on the Las Vegas strip. This action is taking place on an Indian reservation.    Richard Bowers Jr. says the Native American Group is intended to help tribes with basic needs.    Business at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, is booming and contributing to the Seminole Indian Tribe's great wealth.    Now the Seminoles are taking that wealth -- and the power that comes with it -- and using it to do something that has not been done before: organizing Native American tribes with the intent of spreading economic opportunities across Indian Country.    \"Some of these reservations I have been to -- it's like the Third World right here in the United States,\" says Richard Bowers Jr. As president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida Inc., Bowers has oversight over all the Hard Rock caf\u00e9s, hotels and casinos in the world except the caf\u00e9 in London and the casino in Las Vegas.    The Seminole Tribe purchased the Hard Rock properties in 2007 for a reported $965 million.    Bowers, a former alligator wrester and cattle rancher, is thankful for his tribe's success and has used his influence to create a consortium of Native American Tribes called the Native American Group. The goal of this group is to bring tribes throughout the United States and Canada together in an effort to promote Native American-owned businesses and services.    Keeping the dollar within Indian Country, Bowers hopes, will help the less fortunate tribes with basic needs such as housing, food and education.    \"I view this as historic in nature,\" says Donald Laverdure, the chief legal counsel from Montana's Crow Tribe. \"We haven't had first-nation to first-nation actually occur, and now with the success of the Seminoles and others, they have an opportunity to help tribes such as ourselves.\"    The help that the Crow Nation seeks is financial. For the Crow Tribe, gaming is not an option, according to Laverdure.    \"There's less population, so the success in gaming cannot be paralleled as elsewhere,\" he says. \"So we've always viewed our future in energy.\"    That energy would come from coal. The Crow Tribe wants to mine some of the 9 billion tons of coal that it estimates is on its land.    Crow Nation Chairman Cedric Black Eagle hopes the success of his tribe will lie in turning coal into liquid diesel. \"It will open the door for Indian Country in energy fields and help this country start veering away from its dependence on foreign oil,\" he says.    As the group meets to discuss coal, Bowers recalls that it was the need for beef that prompted his idea for the Native American Group.    \"Here we have all these cafes, casinos -- everybody eats a hamburger,\" says Bowers. \"And than (I) realized that we don't have enough beef to supply our own needs, and that's when I reached out to other Native Americans that did have cattle.\"    Bowers discovered there are more than 2 million heads of cattle on Indian land. If there is not enough cattle on Indian land, then members of the group are encouraged to keep the business in the country and buy American.    The Native American Group has come a long way since Bowers was looking for cattle. The group now has more than 100 tribal members and more than 100 Native-owned businesses.    One successful business that joined the group is the largest Native American-owned contractor, Flintco. Robin Flint Ballenger, who is Cherokee, is its chairman of the board.    \"It wasn't a far stretch for me at all to take a risk on this new organization because we are successful, we're doing very well,\" says Ballenger, who adds that a third of the company's work is done for Native America.    One of the projects Flintco is working on is a casino being built on Choctaw tribal land in Durant, Oklahoma.    With every Native American-owned casino, Bowers sees an economic opportunity for all.    \"Trash bags, everybody uses trash bags -- so just for an example, let's all get together and order trash bags and it's going to be cheaper on all of us,\" Bowers says, pointing out that there is a Native American trash bag supplier.    When discussing the potential of the Native American Group, Ballenger remembers something her father used to show her.    \"(He) showed me one stick and [said] you can break one stick easily,\" Ballenger recalls. \"When you bundle many sticks together, it is impossible to break.\"    This is her wish for the consortium -- \"That we will bundle these many sticks together and become impossible to break.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4be9a7e5e9115eb681541c4a8d247ac84f0eb774.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "In what way was Bush firm?", "id": "108428", "answers": [{"text": "with Vladimir Putin\"", "answer_start": 664}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush condemned the escalated violence between Russia and U.S.-backed Georgia on Sunday, while Vice President Dick Cheney said aggression against Georgia \"must not go unanswered.\"    President Bush chats with Russian Prime Minister Vladmir Putin at the  start of the Olympic opening ceremonies.    \"My administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire,\" Bush told NBC's Bob Costas in an interview in Beijing, China, where the president has attended Olympic events.    Bush was filmed speaking to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during Friday's opening ceremonies and said Sunday that he \"was firm with Vladimir Putin\" and that \"this violence is unacceptable.\"    Violence has continued to rage between Russia and the western ally since Thursday, when Georgia launched an operation to crack down on separatists in South Ossetia territory. Russia said it wanted to protect its peacekeepers already in South Ossetia following ceasefires in years past. But Georgia called it a full-on invasion.    And while Russia has accused Georgia of a genocidal plot to cleanse the region of ethnic Ossetians loyal to Russia, Georgia accuses Russia of executing a long-planned war with the aim of taking control of the region -- including a key pipeline that carries Asian oil to Black Sea ports.    \"I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia,\" Bush said of his talk with Putin. \"We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia.\"    Putin says he's concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia. Russian officials said more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days, Interfax reported.    \"The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime, of course, primarily a crime against their own people,\" Putin said, according to Russian news agency Interfax.

If RZA, left, had been jailed or Method Man killed, Wu-Tang may have never formed, RZA says.    Method Man, the group's most recognizable voice, was nearly killed before the band formed, Wu-Tang's chief producer, RZA, writes in his forthcoming memoir.    Meth was walking to buy marijuana at 160 Park Hill Avenue in Staten Island -- the house in Wu-Tang's \"Protect Ya Neck\" video -- when RZA saw him across the street, he writes in the book.    \"Come over here, yo!\" RZA beckoned, according to \"The Tao of Wu\" (Riverhead). \"He stopped and came running over. A few seconds later -- pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! -- a guy started shooting up the front of 160. A buddy of ours, Poppy, an innocent, school-going, nice guy -- he was shot and killed right there.\"  Interactive: Where's the Wu been? \u00bb    It wasn't the only close call RZA said could have snuffed the band that rewrote the rule book for hip-hop acts. The year before the group formed in 1993, RZA was acquitted on an attempted murder charge that could have put him behind bars for eight years, he writes in \"The Tao of Wu,\" out Thursday.    Expanding on the book's anecdotes in an interview with CNN, RZA explained that if he had been imprisoned or if Method Man, aka Clifford Smith, had been killed, the band never would have come to fruition.    RZA, whose real name is Robert Diggs and whose stage name is pronounced \"Rizza,\" also talked about his role in the death of his cousin, Russell Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard or ODB. Two days before his 36th birthday in 2004, ODB died in a New York recording studio from an overdose of cocaine and painkillers.    RZA writes in the book that he once witnessed ODB force his own son to watch him do drugs. RZA tried to leave, he writes, but ODB wouldn't let him. Now, RZA told CNN, he wishes he would've been tougher with ODB about his drug problem.    Following are excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for language, flow and length:    CNN: Could your imprisonment or Method Man's death have derailed Wu-Tang's formation?    RZA: Either one of those incidents could definitely have derailed it. Of course, myself being the abbot, the one who came with the idea, if I wouldn't have made it out of that tumultuous time -- it seemed like I wasn't going to make it out of it; there was a lot of odds against me -- but we stood strong, and self-defense made sense to the jury. We beat that ...    It was the victory over that incident that made me change my whole direction. In a way, it's double-edged in that incident. One, if I would've lost that, yeah, Wu-Tang wouldn't have happened, but also it's the victory of it that inspired me and gave me the drive also to go and really get serious about Wu-Tang and the things I was dealing with.    Same thing with Meth, he always brings it up ... that that day saved his life. He actually said, if it was anybody else calling him, he wouldn't have came.    CNN: In the book, you cite lessons from Eastern religions, Christianity, Islam, [Nation of Islam offshoot] Five Percent, numerology, comic books, kung fu, chess. What would you say to someone who says it's difficult to reconcile these dogmas?    RZA: Like it says in the Bible, \"In the beginning was the word, and the word became flesh\" -- if we go to the root of the word, we will find that, yeah, everything is similar. Everything is teaching us all the same path.    It's just that one religion was good for these people because of their living conditions. In the Quran, they mention paradise being filled with wells, wells of water, and if you're in the desert and you've got a chance to get water and gardens -- as they describe paradise in the holy Quran -- if you're going to get gardens, that's the paradise that fits your situation. ... Everything they're saying relates to the people they're talking to. ...    You remove the messenger and take the message.    CNN: You say in the book that your penchant for violent lyrics in your younger years \"was a product of my history and environment\" and that it no longer represents you. But you also say you won't repudiate violence. Why not?    RZA: One reason I haven't repudiated it is because when it's necessary, it's necessary. [The Bible's] Ecclesiastes tell us there's a time for everything -- a time for war, a time for peace -- so in times for war, there's time for violence.    Then in [the Hindu scripture] Bhagavad Gita, it says Arjuna was talking, Arjuna didn't want to commit violent acts against an army that was attacking him. He couldn't find it in his heart to do it. It was people he loved. He didn't want to get into violence, but Krishna had to point out to him, \"Your duty is your duty.\" ...    So, to me, violence in the light of justice is still violent, but I don't see it the same. It's because of justice that I don't repudiate violence because justice must be served somehow.    CNN: ODB was a product of his environment as well. To what degree were you and other Wu-Tang members responsible for his death?    RZA: The guys would say it's more me than them because they say that's my cousin and I was right there. If you let a man that you love or anybody -- man, woman or child that you love -- sit there and destroy themselves in front of you, you're neglecting them ...    Everybody let him do what he wanted to do. ... There were times when I took his drugs and threw them down the toilet. When I do that, he would get so pissed off I don't see him for weeks after that. ...    So it got to a point, I was like, \"[expletive] it, let him do his drugs\" just to have him around me, just to keep him there. ... But it's still neglect, yo.    CNN: You say you ran Wu-Tang like a dictatorship in its first five years. I know you and Raekwon have had creative differences and Ghostface Killah is suing you over royalties. Ever regret the dictatorship approach?    RZA: I don't regret it because it got us to the power we are. ...    To me, in the beginning, the dictatorship led us to such a strong foundation that even though Wu-Tang seemed to be crumbling, it didn't fall because of the root foundation of one man's idea. But now as it's coming back together -- we're living in the twilight age of it right now -- it's still surviving because of the democracy of it.    CNN: Wu-Tang is still around, but nothing like the heyday of the 1990s. Will we ever see a renaissance?    RZA: Well, to me, Wu-Tang is beyond Wu-Tang Clan. ... It's just like hip-hop is beyond Grandmaster Flash, but Grandmaster Flash was one of the first guys to hit those turntables like that. ...    The same thing with Wu-Tang. You'll see the difference in hip-hop from the moment we came in to before we came in. We changed it. We changed the whole structure.    CNN: Have you accomplished everything you've set out to accomplish?    RZA: I'm me and the me that's me is me and is going to continue to be me, and it's always reaching and growing. I'm grateful for what I've accomplished. I'm grateful for anyone who thinks I accomplished something and says, \"Well he did this; he did that.\" I'm proud to be accepted, but I feel like I've just scratched the surface for some weird reason.

Patients at his hospital received large doses of antibiotics and were scrubbed down with alcohol-based soaps, as he and his colleagues aimed to kill every bacterium possible. Search and destroy was the mantra.    By upending conventional wisdom, Alfonso Torress-Cook was able to slash hospital-acquired infection rates.    Still, patients became sick with bacterial infections after checking in. Some died.    \"I never saw anything change. I saw things getting worse,\" Torress-Cook said.    Torress-Cook eventually joined Pacific Hospital of Long Beach, in California, where as director of epidemiology and patient safety, he changed the rules and slashed the number of patients who become infected.    Torress-Cook is part of a growing movement in medicine that no longer accepts hospital-acquired infections as inevitable complications. Every year, such infections sicken 1.7 million and kill 99,000 people in the United States.    At Pacific Hospital, Torress-Cook doesn't go after all bacteria, just the dangerous ones.    The staff members at the 184-bed hospital use antibiotics sparingly, feed patients yogurt to replenish healthy bacteria in the gut and bathe patients daily, using a soap that maintains the natural pH of the patient's skin, killing only bacteria that don't belong there. Meet some of the people fighting hospital-acquired infections \u00bb    Torress-Cook is also obsessive about hygiene: Nurses clean under patients' fingernails and brush their teeth daily. He also enlisted the hospital's cleaning crew as part of the infection-fighting team. Rooms receive a thorough cleaning every day -- more than simply emptying the trash and mopping the floor, he says.    Under Torress-Cook, Pacific Hospital's infection rate for the so-called superbug MRSA is down to 0.01 per 1,000 discharges, 430 times better than the national average.    Approximately one out of every 22 patients who checks into a U.S. hospital acquires a bacterial infection, adding more than $28 billion to health care costs, according to a 2009 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    But there are signs of improvement. Pennsylvania, which requires the most extensive reporting of hospital-acquired infections, saw the annual rate for all infections drop 8 percent, according to the most recent figures available from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council.    And there are other signs of progress. The development and use of a simple checklist for a common procedure that threads a so-called central line to supply medicine directly to the bloodstream has been extraordinarily effective.    The checklist made central line infections almost nonexistent at the 108 intensive care units in Michigan that adopted it. More than 1,700 lives -- and $246 million -- were saved in the first three years the checklist was adopted, according to the state hospital association.    The checklist is now being adopted in all 50 states and three countries: the United Kingdom, Spain and Peru, says checklist designer Dr. Peter Pronovost, from Johns Hopkins University and Hospitals.    At hospitals large and small, raising the head of the bed for patients on ventilators, brushing patients' teeth and taking other precautions have dramatically reduced ventilator-associated pneumonia, another common and costly infection.    Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, has used these techniques to cut its ventilator-associated pneumonia rate by more than half, to 2.7 cases per 1,000 ventilator days.    \"Our goal is zero,\" says Michelle Farber, a registered nurse who is Mercy's senior infection preventionist.    Simply requiring hospitals to report their infections has forced them to be more accountable to their patients, says Lisa McGiffert, who heads Consumers Union's Stop Hospital Infections campaign, which among other things has pushed for more transparency.    Twenty-six states now have laws requiring hospitals to report rates for urinary tract and other infections.    Paul Levy, CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, is a big fan of publishing infection rates. He puts the hospital's rates on its Web site and on his blog. Simply putting the spotlight on hospital-acquired infections keeps the staff focused, he says.    Hospitals also have a new financial incentive to cut infections.    As of October 1, 2008, Medicare no longer pays hospitals for the added costs incurred by patients who develop catheter-related urinary tract infections and other catheter- or surgery-related infections.    McGiffert says there's been a cultural shift in the past five years.    \"I think it's moving us toward eradication of infection or at least where infections are rare and will not be accepted,\" she says."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/b89fad28208c91b1fe71e5ee310c7c7c44b75144.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What celebration coincided with the attack?", "id": "108435", "answers": [{"text": "big match", "answer_start": 140}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A female suicide bomber in northern Iraq targeted buoyant soccer fans who had just watched their national team win a big match against China, authorities told CNN.    At least 29 people were wounded when the bomber detonated her suicide vest in a marketplace in the Diyala province town of Qara Tappa, a predominantly Shiite Kurdish town with a Shiite Turkmen population.    Col. Ragheb al-Omairi, spokesman for Diyala Military operations command, who confirmed the account, said police on foot patrols were also in the area of bombing.    Twenty-five civilians and four police were wounded, with at least 12 of the civilians in critical condition.    The match, which Iraq won 2-1, was watched avidly across the country by Iraqis of all stripes -- united by their love of soccer.    The game was part of the Asian qualifier for the 2010 South Africa World Cup, and Iraq and China are part of Group 1, along with Australia and Qatar. The match was played in China.    The top two teams in the round advance to another stage of qualifying for the World Cup. Iraq eliminated China from competition and is in the running to advance.    Celebratory gunfire also rang out across Baghdad, and the Baghdad Operations Command put an urgent message on state TV asking people to be careful and avoid shooting to celebrate.    Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki issued congratulations to the team, which last year won the Asia Cup.    The bombing underscored the tensions that persist in a country where violence has dropped.    Twenty females have carried out suicide bombings in Iraq this year, many more than in previous years. According to the U.S. military, women carried out eight bombings in all of 2007.    Authorities said that al Qaeda in Iraq is recruiting women and that more women are offering themselves up for missions.    The officials said the women are desperate and hopeless, most have pre-existing ties to the insurgency, and their main motive is revenge for a male family member killed by U.S. or Iraqi forces in the war.    \"We do see certain members of cells attempting to persuade women, specifically in many cases wives of those who have been killed as terrorists, to conduct suicide operations,\" U.S. Maj. Gen. Mark Hertling said recently. His area of operations includes Diyala province.    Hertling's troops have targeted families of suspected female bombers in a bid to break up the rings that are recruiting the women and girls.    Intelligence gathered from detainees indicates that al Qaeda in Iraq is looking for women who are illiterate, who are deeply religious or who have financial struggles, often because they've lost the male head of the household.    Women and girls always have played a role in the insurgency in Iraq, helping feed militants, hiding them in their homes and helping to sneak weapons around the country.    They have proved to be highly effective in their operations, because women are not searched by men for cultural and religious reasons.    The U.S. military has created a program called the Daughters of Iraq, analogous to the Sons of Iraq, across the Sunni regions of the country. The Daughters of Iraq are being trained to conduct searches of women.

A young girl feeds her baby brother at a refugee camp  on the outskirts of Mogadishu, Somalia.    Relief workers said the fighting between the Somali government and rebels over Islamic law has left Somali civilians with the choice of facing bloody battles or fleeing to squalid camps.    The displaced people have found shelter in already overcrowded camps in and around Mogadishu, while others have fled into neighboring Kenya, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).    OCHA said that an estimated 34,000 people were displaced by the fighting between insurgents and Somalia's government from May 8-14.    Although Somalia's border with Kenya is officially closed, an estimated 5,000 displaced Somalis arrive every month in the U.N. refugee camps in the Kenyan border town of Dadaab, according to Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF.    \"The situation is simply scandalous,\" said Joke Van Peteghem, who heads the MSF mission in Kenya. \"These refugees have risked everything to escape the fighting in Somalia. Now some are telling us they would rather take their chances in Mogadishu than die slowly here.\"    One nurse called the refugee camps in Kenya \"public health time bombs.\"    \"The refugees, many of whom are already suffering from serious war-related injuries or illnesses, are packed together without the bare minimum to survive,\" said Donna Canali, who worked for MSF at Dagahaley Camp.    \"After all these people have endured, how can their most basic needs continue to be so woefully neglected?\"    Nearly a quarter of the more than 90,000 refugees at Dagahaley suffer from acute malnutrition, according to MSF.    MSF is calling on the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Kenya's government, and international donors to help alleviate the \"dire living conditions\" at the camps in Kenya which house more than 270,000 Somali refugees.    More than 100 people have died in the latest fighting in Somalia, and hundreds more have been wounded in the bloody insurgency, government officials said last week.    The violence stems from an interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law. Somalia's new president, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, recently approved implementing sharia, but the al-Shabab rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form.    On Sunday, al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar, the president's hometown about 55 miles (88 km) north of Mogadishu, according to a local journalist.    The violence is exacerbating the already precarious humanitarian situation in Somalia, where an estimated 40 percent of the country's population -- more than 3 million people -- need humanitarian support, according to the U.N.    The fighting erupted days after a mortar attack on Somalia's parliament that killed six people and wounded more than a dozen others on April 25. The fatalities included a soldier and three children who were killed when the rounds struck a nearby school, a police spokesman said.    Members of parliament were meeting when the attack occurred, but none of them was injured, an official said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/29519eeb37cc5798ff1639c25eaa2e80c801d109.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what Second Marine, who filmed the incident?", "id": "108438", "answers": [{"text": "Sgt.

Chinese military officers after a meeting about the People's Liberation Army in 2007.      The annual report from the Pentagon to Congress says China's total military spending in 2007 was between $97 billion and $139 billion, but it is hard to tell exactly how much was spent and on what.      In comparison, the U.S. military budget request for 2008 is $481.4 billion, not including war requests.      Pentagon officials said a chunk of China's spending went to cyberwarfare, because 2007 saw several \"intrusions\" believed to be from the Peoples Liberation Army. In the incidents, unclassified U.S. military computer systems were broken into and information was taken, according to Pentagon officials.      While the information taken was not classified, Pentagon officials said the worry is the Chinese hacking required many of the skills and capabilities that would also be required for a computer network attack.      Last summer, a cyber-attack on Department of Defense computer systems took down the e-mail capability of hundreds of staffers for weeks, but the Pentagon still will not comment on who initiated the attack. It is widely believed among the military to have been the Peoples Liberation Army.      China is also investing heavily in and fielding improved nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and antisatellite missiles, according to the report.      The United States expressed its concern last year after China fired a missile at one of its old satellites and destroyed it, sending thousands of dangerous pieces of space debris into orbit.      The United States conducted a similar strike last month on a broken U.S. spy satellite before it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. U.S. officials said the satellite was hit and broke into thousands of small pieces that burned up as they re-entered Earth's atmosphere.      The United States is also concerned about the purchase of more submarines by the Chinese navy as well as plans for more aircraft carriers. The Chinese once had a small Navy. Now the United States is keeping an eye on the growing service amid concerns over Taiwan.      The concerns include \"China's near-term focus on preparing for contingencies in the Taiwan Strait, including the possibility of U.S. intervention, which is an important driver of its modernization,\" the report says.      Additionally, the Chinese have placed about 100 more short-range missiles on the shore opposite Taiwan in the past year, it says.      Pentagon officials worry the continued increase in Chinese military spending is slowly tipping the balance of power between China and Taiwan in China's favor. The United States has said it would help defend Taiwan if China invaded.      The report also says the Peoples Liberation Army is \"pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short-duration, high-intensity conflicts along its periphery against high-tech adversaries.\"      Such an army, the report says, would have \"the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could, over time, offset traditional U.S. military advantages.\"      The United States says the lack of transparency by the Chinese on its spending poses \"risks to stability by increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation,\" and that China has yet to explain to the international community the purpose of its military expansion, Pentagon officials said.

But if you haven't considered \"greening your love life, you are still a total environmental disaster,\" according to Stefanie Iris Weiss, author of the recently released book, \"Eco-Sex.\"      How should it work? Should you envision melting glaciers during a romantic dinner with your significant other?      Well, not quite.      It could be as simple as where you choose to go on a date.      \"How about going to a restaurant where you can eat a seductive menu based on organic, local food, which has produced less carbon dioxide before it ends up on your plate?\" Weiss suggested.      She is hoping to steer people away from \"dirty\" sex toward eco-sex. That means:      \u2022 Hop on your bike for your next date and leave your car at home. (That means saying \"adieu\" to long-distance relationships.)      \u2022 Stop excessive spending on Valentine's Day. (It produces way too much trash anyway.)      \u2022 Wear comfy bamboo underwear.      \u2022 Don't be so keen on having babies. How about adopting a child instead or implementing a one-child policy?      Weiss' theory is not entirely new. Greenpeace published a guide to \"environmentally friendly sex\" in 2002, which includes \"switching off the lights during romance\" or \"if you want to see your partner, have sex during the day.\"      But Weiss goes further: She covers everything from your first date to raising your kids \"green.\"      She also suggests keeping the environment in mind when your sex drive is fading. Viagra, she says, is overrated.      \"People should eat oysters as an aphrodisiac instead,\" Weiss says. \"They are a full of zinc, a precursor of testosterone. Casanova himself was known to eat them in great quantities before sex.\"      On the streets of Washington, the idea of an eco-friendly love life is met with laughter.      \"How green is my love life? Are you serious? Don't be absurd!\" were the most common reactions from people on the street.      But the concept is in full display at a local sex shop.      \"We sell organic oils, edible underwear and toys that are completely recyclable,\" says Luis Cadillos, a salesman at Georgetown's \"Pleasure Place.\" \"The problem is our customers are embarrassed to dispose their toys properly.\" He says he thinks promoting an eco-friendly sex life could be \"big business.\"      \"We should have an extra shelf for our green-conscious customers,\" Cadillos suggests.      His colleague, Paula Kov, is less enthusiastic about the idea.      \"I try to live environmentally friendly, but it goes way over the top to think about [carbon dioxide reduction] in my love life,\" she says.      Climate activist Mike Tidwell disagrees.      \"I never thought about how green my love life is. But in fact this is about reducing our extensive consumption and that should concern every part of our life,\" he says.      Tidwell, who is the director of Chesapeake Climate Action Network in Washington, decided long ago to have only one child.      \"But I am glad the book doesn't prohibit making love outdoors,\" Tidwell joked. \"That produces zero carbon dioxide.\"      It's clear in Weiss' 200-page book that she is using sex to promote a completely green lifestyle.      But is that such a bad thing?      \"With sex anything sells. Even the environment,\" Weiss says.      She says she is hoping that, in the midst of the global climate crisis debate, her book \"may finally approach those green-grumps, who don't know the basics about living an environmentally friendly life.\"      That doesn't seem likely after reading conservative blogger William Teach's post on her book:      \"I actually hope the climate alarmists, consisting of mostly liberals, take her advice on how to have eco-friendly sex without getting pregnant,\" Teach posted on rightwingnews.com.      \"The world could use a whole lot less unhinged liberals taught by their unhinged liberal parents.\"      John Bargh, who teaches psychology at Yale University, sees a different problem with the eco-sex theory.      Thinking about the environmental impact of your love life, he says, goes against human nature.      \"Human beings are irrational,\" he says. \"We make decisions based on our desire, especially when it comes to love.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/36882fd476e06e9e06a61216b3904429e9ee7f96.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is Top suspected of?", "id": "108445", "answers": [{"text": "several Indonesian bombings", "answer_start": 60}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- A suspected terrorist linked to several Indonesian bombings in the past decade was killed in a protracted firefight Saturday in the Central Java town of Temanggung, two law enforcement sources told CNN.    A poster in Malang, East Java, Indonesia, has under \"dicari,\" or\"wanted,\" Noordin Top.    Another raid by police Saturday averted a planned assassination attempt on Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, authorities said.    Noordin M. Top was killed during a raid by the anti-terrorism unit Detachment 88 that began Friday and lasted 18 hours into Saturday, said a police source and a security analyst with close ties to the police.    Official confirmation of Top's identity will come next week after DNA results, said Indonesia's National Police Chief, Bambang Hendarso.    Indonesia's anti-terrorism forces had been hunting Top for the past six years. He is also the main suspect in last month's twin hotel bombings in Jakarta.    A statement attributed to Top, 40, a Malaysian-born explosives expert, claimed responsibility for the attacks that targeted Jakarta's JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels. The coordinated bombings killed seven people and the two suspected bombers, and wounded more than 50.  Watch more about the raid \u00bb    It was the first major terrorist attack in Indonesia in more than three years.    Top is reportedly an officer, recruiter, bomb-maker and trainer for a splinter group of the militant organization Jemaah Islamiyah, which has ties to al Qaeda. He allegedly was involved in a previous attack on the Marriott in Jakarta in August 2003, as well as attacks on a Bali nightclub in 2002 and the Australian embassy in Jakarta in 2004, according to the FBI.    In February 2006, the FBI added Top to its list of 10 suspected terrorists who have not been charged in the United States, and are wanted only for questioning.    The ramifications of Top's death were not immediately clear.    \"This is a huge advance in Indonesia's fight against terror,\" said Sidney Jones, a senior Asia adviser for the International Crisis Group, a global nonpartisan advisory organization. \"But this is not the end of it because we still don't know the extent of the network and the funding source of Noordin's network.\"    Three to four people were believed to be holed up in the house in Temanggung, police said.    Security forces had launched a raid on the house after two people believed to be nephews of its owner were arrested earlier in the day, according to the official Antara News Agency.    \"Police officers entered the house and fired profusely inside the house while other policemen surrounded the house and opened its windows by force,\" Antara said.    After the gunfire ended, local television showed police with their helmets off, shaking hands and carrying caskets into the house, suggesting that those inside the house had been killed or captured.    Also on Saturday, in a house on the outskirts of Jakarta, Indonesian police killed two militants believed to be connected with a 2004 bombing and found a cache of explosives in an early morning raid, the national police chief said.    Hendarso said that police found about 100 kg (220 lbs) of explosives along with bomb-making materials and a truck, which they did not immediately open for fear it might have been rigged to explode.    Those bomb-making materials were going to be used in an attack on the president, Hendarso said.    The two militants killed are believed to be connected with the 2004 bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta in which 16 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded, Hendarso said.    Also, a man identified as Suryana, who uses the aliases Yayan and Gepeng, was arrested in north Jakarta on suspicion of terrorism charges, said Nanan Soekarna, police inspector general.    Soekarna could not say whether Suryana was connected with last month's hotel bombings or other incidents.

William Safire died in Maryland following a battle with pancreatic cancer, The New York Times reported.    Safire joined the Times as a columnist in 1973. In addition to his conservative news columns, which he wrote until 2005, he wrote a language column for the paper's Sunday magazine from 1979 until shortly before his death.    He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1978. In 2006, President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor.    Safire had suffered from pancreatic cancer and died Sunday at a hospice in Rockville, Maryland, the newspaper reported.    Born in New York in 1929, Safire began his career as a reporter for newspapers, television and radio stations after dropping out of Syracuse University. After becoming a public relations executive in the late 1950s, he was credited with putting together the 1959 \"kitchen debate\" between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at that year's American National Exhibition in Moscow.    Safire was the publicist for a builder at the time.    \"What I was publicizing was the typical American house,\" he recounted during a conference at George Washington University in July. \"It was my kitchen.\"    The next year, he went to work for Nixon's first, unsuccessful presidential bid. He rejoined the Nixon team in 1968, when the Republican eventually won the White House, and became one of the administration's top speechwriters.    Perhaps his best-known line in that job was Vice President Spiro Agnew's denunciation of journalists as \"nattering nabobs of negativism.\" But Safire left the administration to join that nattering club in 1973, when he left the Nixon administration to join the Times.    His often-pugnacious voice -- he once denounced then-first lady Hillary Clinton as a \"congenital liar\" -- held down the right flank of the Times' op-ed page for more than three decades. He won his Pulitzer in 1978 for columns on the travails surrounding Bert Lance, who as President Carter's budget director in 1977 resigned amid allegations of bank fraud. Lance was acquitted by a federal jury in 1980.    And he was an outspoken advocate of the plight of Iraq's Kurdish population. He sharply criticized U.S. support for Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, when Hussein used poison gas to put down a Kurdish revolt, and he strongly supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, writing that \"nobody came out of this war more nobly\" than the Kurds.    Safire also wrote four novels, several collections of columns and a political dictionary that was first published in 1968. A new edition came out in 2008.    He is survived by his wife, Helene, two children and one grandchild."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/fd8b48109a66ec4aca9e490d9ecc9a3bf9515b3c.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was known to the local gun shop owner", "id": "108449", "answers": [{"text": "Amrani", "answer_start": 2416}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Liege, Belgium (CNN) -- Flowers, teddy bears and candles mark the spot Wednesday where a gunman tossed grenades into a crowded Liege market square a day before, claiming several lives and wounding scores more.      The mood in Place St. Lambert, a square which would normally be bustling with Christmas shoppers, was somber Wednesday as Belgians took stock of an attack unprecedented in their history.      Workers at the Christmas market opened up their stalls, housed in wooden cabins, but trade was slow.      One woman said they had been told they could start trading later, if they wanted first to pay tribute to the five people killed and 130 wounded before the attacker, Liege resident Nourdine Amrani, apparently took his own life.      Market stall holder Julie Six-Bourgoin was still shaking as she talked about Tuesday's attack, calling it \"horrible\" and comparing its effect on the peaceful country to that of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.      Other people in the city said that Christmas would not be the same and that they could not understand why the attack occurred.      Officials say Amrani, 33, who had no record of mental illness, hurled his three grenades and fired a pistol and semi-automatic weapon from an elevated walkway above a bus stop in the square.      The attack seemed to have left the city's people with a new sense of vulnerability, with those waiting for buses Wednesday standing back under the walkway, as if to protect themselves from another aerial assault.      Chunks missing from a granite wall testified to the ferocity of the grenade blasts, with bullet holes also pocking the hard surface.      One mother who was a few yards away from the gunman when he opened fire said she now feared for the safety of her children. Another recounted how her children had left school early and passed through the bus stop only shortly before it was attacked, narrowly avoiding the tragedy.      In a restaurant, near-silence replaced the usual hubbub, as people appeared to withdraw into themselves, reflecting on the tragedy just a day earlier.      So far, public anger over the attack seems limited. Few questions have yet been asked about how a man convicted of weapons offenses was able to get his hands on guns and grenades.      The owner of one of the city's two main gun stores, which appeared to stock dozens of automatic-style weapons, said he knew Amrani but refused to answer further questions.      Police are investigating whether Amrani bought the weapons used in the attack on the black market, said Katrin Delcourt, spokeswoman for the provincial governor's office.      She said Amrani, who held a French hunting license under which he bought at least one firearm before his 2008 conviction, was skilled in using and maintaining weapons.      A woman, said to be a cleaner in her late 40s, was found dead in a residence next to a workshop where Amrani once grew marijuana, local police said. But he seems to have kept a relatively low profile in the area.      Neighbors of Amrani who spoke to CNN said they had seldom seen him around. One man said he had realized Amrani was a neighbor only after recognizing his picture in a newspaper.      Amrani, a Belgian citizen, had been released from prison on conditional parole in October 2010 but returned to the attention of police in November this year.      He had been asked to attend a police interview on the day of the attack in connection with allegations of sexual offenses, the Liege prosecutor said.      So far, public scrutiny has not yet turned to why he was not arrested and brought in for questioning, given his track record.      But as the city's shock fades and investigations continue into what led him to launch his deadly gun and grenade rampage, such questions will likely come to the forefront.

He died at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, surrounded by his wife, Annette, daughters Annette and Katrina and many of his 18 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, according to his office.    Lantos' life was \"defined by courage, optimism, and unwavering dedication to his principles and to his family,\" said his wife, Annette, his childhood sweetheart, in a statement the House of Representatives released.    Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday that she was \"quite devastated\" by the death of her \"dear, dear friend.\"    She called him \"a true American hero\" and \"the genuine article.\" \"He's going to be really, really missed,\" she said.    Rice described Lantos as \"the embodiment of what it meant to have one's freedom denied and then to find it and to insist that Americans stand for spreading the benefits of freedom and prosperity to others.\"    Lantos, who was serving his 14th term in the House, was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in December. He announced last month that he would not seek a new term.    \"It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground could have received an education, raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of Congress,\" Lantos said in a statement at the time.    \"I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country.\"  Watch Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid remember Lantos \u00bb    The lawmaker is the only Holocaust survivor to have served in Congress.    The Hungarian-born Lantos came to the United States in 1947 after surviving a forced-labor camp in his Nazi-allied homeland. He escaped and was sheltered in a Budapest safe house set up by Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who was credited with saving tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II.    He arrived in the United States after being awarded an academic scholarship to study, according to his congressional Web site. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from the University of Washington in Seattle and later earned a doctorate in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, the site said.    As a lawmaker, Lantos was an outspoken human rights advocate.

James von Brunn ignored the advice of the judge and his defense attorney and addressed the court during a hearing to fight any delays as prosecutors press their case.    \"Your Constitution guarantees me a speedy and fair trial,\" he said from his wheelchair during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Reginald Walton.    But Walton granted the defense request for a mental evaluation, which will take place within the next 30 days at a facility in Butner, North Carolina.    Von Brunn, a self-avowed white supremacist, will remain in custody after the judge said there were no conditions for release that would protect the public. Federal prosecutor Nicole Waid said von Brunn is \"dangerous because this defendant has nothing to lose,\" and that he wants to be \"a martyr for his cause.\"    Von Brunn's attorney, public defender A.J. Kramer, did not challenge the government's request to deny bail, saying \"we don't have any evidence to offer at this time.\"    Kramer also convinced the judge to order a competency exam, which will include observations as to whether von Brunn understands the charges and can assist in his own defense.    Prosecutors said four of the charges in the indictment are capital offenses and could mean the death penalty if he is convicted.    Waid told the judge the government's evidence is \"overwhelming\" and includes security camera video from the June 10 attack, in which von Brunn is seen raising a gun and shooting guard Stephen Tyrone Johns, who had opened the door for him.    As Johns stumbled back mortally wounded, Waid said, \"you can see the defendant fire two more times,\" before he is shot and wounded by other guards.

GEORGE, Utah (CNN) -- A young man whose arranged marriage to a young cousin led to the conviction of polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs was charged Wednesday with her rape.    Prosecutors filed the rape charge against Allen Steed, 26, a day after a jury found Jeffs guilty of two rape-accomplice counts in connection with Steed's ill-fated 2001 marriage to Elissa Wall.    Jurors found that Jeffs used his authority as leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, to push the girl into a marriage she did not want.    Steed was 19 and his bride, who also was his first cousin, was 14 when Jeffs \"sealed\" them in spiritual marriage at a motel in Caliente, Nevada, where many FLDS weddings were performed. Three other couples also were married that day in separate ceremonies, according to testimony.    Steed is accused of having sex with the girl against her will several weeks into the marriage.    Steed testified for the defense at Jeffs' trial. He said his new wife was affectionate to him in private, but cold in public. He denied that he or Jeffs had forced sex on her.    Wall agreed to be identified publicly as the trial ended in hopes of encouraging other women who feel trapped by polygamy to come forward.  Watch Wall urge other girls to be brave \u00bb    She testified that she told Steed she was not ready and that her first sexual encounter made her feel dirty, used and trapped.    Her pleas to church leaders to end the marriage were ignored, and Jeffs told her to submit \"mind, body and soul\" to her new husband, Wall told the jury.    Her sisters testified that most of the women in the family also opposed the marriage but were powerless to stop it.    According to the criminal complaint, the trial established that the pair had sex and that the young woman had convinced jurors she did not consent.    Wall left the marriage and the FLDS in 2004. She is now remarried.    An attorney for Steed could not be reached.    Jeffs, 51, leads the 10,000-member FLDS, which is based in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona.

Pakistan's capital was rocked by a suicide attack on the city's Marriott Hotel at the weekend.    Officers emptied the parking lot at the Benazir Bhutto International Airport, on the outskirts of Islamabad, said Parvez George of the country's Civil Aviation Authority.    Flights were going out of the airport, but police cleared the terminal building of the large crowds that usually gather to see relatives arrive or depart, George said.    Muhammad Asghar of Islamabad Police told CNN that authorities placed the airport on high alert after intelligence reports indicated it was under threat of an attack.    The country's capital city is on edge since a deadly blast Saturday night at the Marriott Hotel. The explosion killed more than 50 people, including two U.S. military personnel and the Czech ambassador to Pakistan.    The bombing wounded more than 250 and sparked a fire that left the hotel in ruins.    On Thursday, the Danish intelligence service said one of its employees, Karsten Krabbe, was among the victims of the blast.    Krabbe, a 53-year-old married father of two, was a security adviser at the Danish Embassy in Islamabad, which was targeted by a suicide bomber in June. That attack killed six people and wounded more than 20.    \"Karsten Krabbe lost his life in a cowardly and ruthless terror attack,\" the Danish intelligence service said in a statement.    Reacting to the Saturday's attack, the U.S. government barred employees from major hotels in several Pakistani cities, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said.    The Embassy in Islamabad added Lahore on Wednesday to a list of three other cities in which U.S. personnel are no longer allowed to visit or stay in major hotels.    The Embassy took the measures because of general security concerns, said spokesman Lou Fintor Thursday. He did not comment on a specific threat.

The U.S. Coast Guard said it has witnessed only normal maritime traffic around Haiti, and it has not intercepted any Haitians attempting illegal crossings into U.S. waters. Nor does it see people preparing for voyages .      Florida officials have asked for federal government funding to shelter 10,000 refugees, but said that was done only as a precaution.      Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force continues daily flights of its EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft -- a radio station in the sky -- which is broadcasting warnings to would-be migrants, as well as information about where people can find food and aid.      List of missing, found people in Haiti      The plane is broadcasting a recorded message from Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the United States, saying: \"Listen, don't rush on boats to leave the country. Because I'll be honest with you: If you think you will reach the U.S. and all the doors will be wide open to you, that's not at all the case. And they will intercept you right on the water and send you back home where you came from.\"      State Department deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said the message is \"part of the U.S. effort to help keep Haitians safe.\"      \"We don't want people to endanger their lives by taking risk to try to get to the U.S. at this time,\" he said.      The U.S. military will be distributing special radios to Haitians this week in an effort to get messages and news spread as far as possible.      Some 50,000 portable solar-powered and windup radios will be distributed by the U.S. military joint task force that is deploying troops in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and other severely stricken parts of the country.      Government officials say past migrations from Cuba and Haiti were the result of large geopolitical events, circumstances that differ significantly from those in Haiti now. Further, there is a large U.S. government presence in Haiti and offshore -- factors that will make any migration easier for the government to detect.      \"At this point, we are not expecting a massive influx of Haitian individuals,\" said Mike Stone, spokesman for the Florida Emergency Operations Center. Immediately after the January 12 quake, the state \"dusted off\" a preparedness plan known as Operation Vigilant Sentry \"just in case,\" he said.      The plan has been in place since 2003.      David Halstead, director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said the state's request for \"safe housing\" for 10,000 Haitian survivors was based on the plan. That is the maximum number Florida officials believe the state could support in any mass migration, and only for a limited period, he said. It is based on the expectation that people would first be housed at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and federal immigration detention centers.      \"I think right now, with everyone watching Haiti ... for any boat or ship to be able to get out of there illegally would be a miracle upon itself,\" Halstead said Tuesday.      The U.S. Coast Guard said it has seen \"nothing out of the ordinary\" off Haiti's coast in recent days. Ferry vessels have been crowded, \"but they're not going anyplace we wouldn't expect them to,\" Lt. Cmdr. Christopher O'Neil said.      Haitians have migrated to the United States by boat in relatively small numbers for at least the past 30 years, with several notable spikes. An estimated 25,000 Haitians were among the mass migration of more than 150,000 asylum seekers, primarily Cubans, during the Mariel boatlift in 1980. In the early 1990s, tens of thousands of Haitians migrated to the United States after the coup d'etat deposing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, is pictured in Afghanistan in November 2007.    (CNN) -- The private military contractor formerly known as Blackwater has held classified contracts with the Central Intelligence Agency for nearly a decade, but an allegation that the contractor was part of a secret CIA program to kill al Qaeda operatives -- if true -- would take the relationship to a whole new level.    The CIA hired the private security firm Blackwater USA in 2004 to work on a covert program aimed at targeting and potentially killing top al Qaeda leaders, a source familiar with the program told CNN.    Former company executives deny knowing about the program. Current leaders of the company did not return calls to CNN. The CIA won't comment on classified contracts.    The classified program, canceled by CIA director Leon Panetta earlier this year, was part of a broader effort inside the CIA to develop the capacity to conduct training, surveillance and possible covert operations overseas, according to the source. The program was outsourced to contractors to \"put some distance\" between the effort and the U.S. government.    Other contractors were brought in for other parts of the program, another source said, and Blackwater's involvement ended by mid-2006.    But one thing is clear: The company that renamed itself Xe earlier this year in an effort to escape controversy surrounding a 2007 shooting in Baghdad that left 17 Iraqis dead has had a long relationship with the world's most famous spy agency.    When Erik Prince first opened his Blackwater training facility in the late '90s, his clients included special forces teams and law enforcement agencies from around the country. Prince had expressed frustration with the training facilities he visited during his time as a Navy SEAL, and a sizable inheritance allowed him the financial freedom to retire from the military and try his hand at creating a better facility.    His first clients were indeed SEAL teams. But they also included teams from other government agencies, including the CIA. Case officers and protection details, the people generally accustomed to working in the shadows, began showing up for training on the shooting range or the driving track in a rural part of North Carolina.    When then-CIA Executive Director Alvin \"Buzzy\" Krongard, whose own son was a Navy SEAL, visited the facility, former Blackwater President Gary Jackson suggested he meet with Prince, who worked out of an office in the Washington area. The two had lunch and Krongard immediately took a liking to the man who would later lead the world's most notorious private contracting company.    At the time, contacts like these were essential to building the business, so when terror struck the heart of America in September 2001, Prince called up his new friend Krongard and offered to help. Sources inside the agency at the time say that Krongard in fact, was pushing hard for Blackwater to be given the first urgent and compelling, no-bid contract to protect CIA facilities in Afghanistan. The military, it seems, wasn't up to the task of staffing such an effort.    Once awarded the initial contract, Prince maintained a close relationship with Krongard, and made trips to Afghanistan to make sure things were going smoothly.    The idea that the agency came to Blackwater for help on any other contracts, including one with the overall goal of locating and assassinating al Qaeda operatives, wouldn't come as a huge surprise, particularly since so much of the intelligence budget is spent on private contractors.    But with investigations under way into just what was done and by whom at the CIA under the Bush administration, people are remaining tight-lipped. Especially under the threat of possible prosecution, should it go that far."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/c4239cb9dac0e0257ce5467860762dc128141c10.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where can you take a stroll?", "id": "108463", "answers": [{"text": "Cavallo Point: The Lodge at the Golden Gate,", "answer_start": 546}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(Sunset) -- An insider shares five top experiences in Sausalito, California, you won't read about in guidebooks.    Waldo Point Harbor is one of several scenic houseboat communities in Sausalito.    Off-the-path pier    You'll want a bike or a car to get to the Fort Baker fishing pier, which sits in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge and has unbeatable views across the bay to San Francisco. In summer, foghorns bellow loudly from here, but in December, fishermen and pelicans are more the order of the day.    A short walk north is eco-luxe Cavallo Point: The Lodge at the Golden Gate, which was big news in town when it debuted last summer. Even if you don't stay there, stop for a glass of wine in the clubby Farley Bar.    Locals' beach    Schoonmaker Beach is a bit farther from downtown, but still doable on foot and well worth finding. My son and I have whiled away many sunny mornings here, wading in the bay and watching sailboats.    The beach bumped up to our number one favorite in April with the addition of Le Garage, a French bistro steps from the sand and, hands down, the best new restaurant in town in ages. Grab a seat next to the roll-up glass garage door and definitely try the mussels Proven\u00e7ale. Sunset.com: 20 perfect summer trips    Undiscovered hike    You can't spend time in Sausalito and not make it to the Marin Headlands, just a mile outside town -- it'd be like going to Yosemite and missing Half Dome. So join the parade of cars winding up twisty Conzelman Road to Hawk Hill, but don't stop there.    Drive a bit farther to the beach parking area on your left, and you'll see signs for the trail to Black Sands Beach. The 0.75-mile hike down (slightly rickety) steps is sure to put the rosy in your cheeks, and the narrow strip of beach is windy, wild and stunning.    My secret? Instead of starting from the beach parking area, I like to drive past the Marin Headlands Visitor Center, turn right on Bunker Road, and start at the historic rifle range. It's worth the extra 1.5 miles over the ridge for the views you'll have all to yourself. Sunset.com: Our amazing national parks    Best shopping street    There's more to Sausalito shopping than the chintzy souvenir shops that line the main drag downtown. Just a 10-minute walk north of the waterfront lies leafy Caledonia Street, home to several locally owned galleries and framing shops, plus Flying Oliver Books, where we always find deals on used cookbooks.    I love to look at the black-and-white photography at Sausalito Picture Framing and pick up letterpress holiday cards and fashionable ribbons and papers for present wrapping at Pinestreet Papery.    And one block to the east on Bridgeway is McCloud Design, with streamlined modern container gardens, handcrafted fountains and outdoor furniture. Sunset.com: Outdoor dining rooms    Hidden harbor    Sausalito wouldn't be Sausalito without its houseboats. Among several houseboat communities in town, Waldo Point Harbor stands out for its hilarious, only-in-Sausalito message board at the harbor entrance.    On my all-star list: \"Lost: Plywood dinghy, battered blue\" (alongside a charmingly rakish drawing of the poor lost boat) and \"Want to exchange your houseboat with mine in Paris for a week?\" Impressive feats of container gardening -- succulents, roses, lemon trees -- line the boardwalk, and residents are often out watering plants in the early morning.    Truth be told, I did once catch a minibus of Japanese tourists being let off in this area, but that was in the height of summer, and they seemed to walk right past Issaquah Dock, our favorite spot.

The declarations come in the wake of increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia's invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO.    Russian ships will make a port of call in Venezuela later this year and the two nations could hold joint naval exercises for the first time, both sides said.    Russia denied there was any link between Monday's announcement and the conflict in the Caucasus, although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long antagonized Washington.    \"This is a planned event unrelated to the current political situation and Caucasian developments,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said Monday. \"The exercises will not be targeted against any third party.\"    The agreement on the Russian visit to Venezuelan ports was reached long before the conflict in the Caucasus broke out, he said.    But he appeared to suggest Monday that Russia had proposed the joint naval maneuvers.    \"If the Venezuelan side finds the proposal interesting and an agreement is reached, Russia and Venezuela may hold joint naval exercises in line with international practice,\" he said.    Several hours later, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Washington is canceling the proposed \"123 Agreement\" with Moscow, which would have cleared the way for more trade of nuclear technology, services and goods between the two countries.    He denied the pullout was directly linked to Moscow's actions in the Caucasus.    \"Over a period of time, we've had some deep concerns about Russian behavior. And quite clearly the president has taken this action looking at the facts,\" he said.    Both countries had accepted the agreement and it was awaiting congressional approval.    Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned in an exclusive interview with CNN last week that Russia would not be pleased at the collapse of the 123 Agreement, which is named after a section of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954.    \"This would effectively kill any possibility for our cooperation to promote the Bush-Putin initiative on nuclear nonproliferation -- which is important for the entire world,\" he said.    \"As I said, it wouldn't be our choice, but if the United States does not want to cooperate with us on one or another issue, we cannot impose ourselves on Washington.\"    But experts say Congress was unlikely to have given the deal a green light, and that the White House was making the best of a bad situation.    \"I think [the administration is] making a virtue out of a necessity\" by pulling out, said Russia analyst Jon Wolfsthal of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, last week.    On the possibility of Russian-Venezuelan naval exercises, Latin America expert Wayne S. Smith warned against reading too much into the proposal.    \"The Russians have complained about U.S. warships operating in the Black Sea, which is an area of intense interest to them. It would not be surprising if they returned the favor by having joint exercises in the Caribbean,\" said Smith, a 25-year foreign service veteran who ended his State Department career as chief of the U.S. Interest Section in Havana.    \"It's a way of saying: 'Two can play at this game. If you think you can send ships into the Black Sea without response, you are mistaken.' \"    But he said the mere fact of Russian ships operating in the Western hemisphere would not necessarily be dangerous.    \"The act itself is not. Having naval exercises? Fine, as long as both sides take it for what it is. It's not a threatening gesture, it's a message.\"    Frank Mora, a Latin America expert at the National Defense University in Washington, said the announcement could be part of a complicated bargaining process, depending on whether relations improve between Moscow and Washington.    \"Something tells me that soon enough something will happen to tone this down, and possibly this exercise with the Venezuelans could be used to pull back on this issue,\" Mora said. \"If things improve [the Russians] could pull back as a sign of commitment to improving the relationship. If tensions remain I see the possibility that this kind of exercise would occur.\"    He said the Venezuelans have little to contribute to a military alliance with Russia.    \"They have a couple of destroyers, a couple of old submarines, and frigates that can launch surface-to-air missiles -- not anything sophisticated or robust. This would not be a robust exercise. It would be more about indicating strategic cooperation.\"    But he suggested that if the exercise does go ahead, it would be a sign of increased Russian confidence vis-a-vis the United States.    \"They feel they are strong enough and bold enough to do something in our sphere of influence,\" he said.    Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman appeared to shrug off the announcement.    \"We exercise all around the globe and have joint exercises with countries all over the world; so do many other nations,\" he said.    Chavez said Sunday that Caracas was prepared to receive the Russians in late November or December, according Venezuela's ministry of communications.    But he indicated Venezuela might not be prepared for military exercises by then.    \"We're only in the planning phase. We're not ready yet for the visit and the probable maneuvers to happen in September or October, or even November. So it could happen, if not at the end of November, then at the beginning of December,\" he said.    Nesterenko said the Russian flotilla will include \"the heavy nuclear-propelled missile cruiser Pyotr Veliki and the large anti-submarine ship Admiral Chabanenko.\"    The announcement comes only days after a U.S. Navy command ship, the USS Whitney, arrived in the Georgian port town of Poti in what the United States called a humanitarian mission. The ship reached Poti on Friday.    Russia said the fact that a military vessel is being used in a relief mission raises concerns.    Russia has become a major supplier of arms to Venezuela since 2001. The two countries signed a series of deals worth $3 billion in 2006, including fighter aircraft, transport and attack helicopters, and assault rifles, according to Jane's, the defense intelligence publication.    Chavez visited Moscow in July for his first meeting with new Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Charles Schumer of New York announced they would support the retired federal judge from New York just hours after the chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition to the nominee.  Feinstein and Schumer are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to vote on the Mukasey nomination Tuesday.  If all the Republican members of the committee also vote for Mukasey, which is expected, his nomination will go before the full Senate. A leading Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday Mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the Judiciary Committee.  Schumer had praised the nomination of Mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced Mukasey as his choice to replace former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Gonzales gave up the post in September.  \"This is an extremely difficult decision,\" Schumer said.  \"When an administration so political, so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge, we are never left with an ideal choice. Judge Mukasey is not my ideal choice. However, Judge Mukasey, whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him, is far better than anyone could expect from this administration.\"  A number of Democratic senators, however, have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called \"waterboarding\" and the president's power to order electronic surveillance.  Waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning.  Mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding \"repugnant,\" but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture.  While saying \"serious questions have been raised about Judge Mukasey's views on torture and on separation of powers,\" Feinstein said she would support the nominee because the Justice Department needed fresh leadership.  \"First and foremost, Michael Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales. Rather, he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the Southern District of New York.  \"I believe that Judge Mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments, allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by Congress.\"  Just hours before Feinstein and Schumer announced their decisions, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, announced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination.  Watch Sen. Leahy explain why he can't support the Mukasey nomination \u00bb  \"No American should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture,\" Leahy said. \"Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the Spanish Inquisition. We prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding after World War II.  \"I am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the Department of Justice. I like Michael Mukasey. I wish that I could support his nomination. But I cannot. America needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one, not even the president, is above the law.\"  President Bush demanded the Senate confirm Mukasey during a speech Thursday at the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank.  \"In a time of war, it's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place,\" the president said.  The president has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the CIA-run interrogation program, whose details are classified.  Bush said the program does not violate U.S. bans on torture, but added that Mukasey \"does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy.\"  But Leahy said \"Judge Mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret 'facts and circumstances.' \"  \"He was asked whether waterboarding is illegal. Our law makes torture illegal, and waterboarding is torture, and it is illegal. It is frankly not dependent on any, quote, 'relevant facts and circumstances of the technique's past or proposed use,' \" he said, quoting from Mukasey's response to senators on the question.  Sources with knowledge of the CIA-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding. But those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al Qaeda's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.  The practice was used by the Spanish Inquisition, Cambodia's Khmer Rouge and the World War II Japanese military, according to Human Rights Watch. It is specifically banned in U.S. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the U.S. military.

As the plane started to go down, some passengers shouted to those in exit rows to be prepared to quickly open the doors.    Berretta spent that time contemplating the chances of surviving a water crash.    \"I think that [it] certainly went through my mind that this probably very much could be it,\" he said.

T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta.  The entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested Saturday just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards.  The small court room of Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman was packed with family, supporters and media, but even more people, including the rapper's mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding.  Harris, 27, was arrested in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement.  Watch a search of the rapper's home \u00bb  He was held in federal custody over the weekend.  Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon.  Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past.  However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that \"a number of people\" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were \"two sides to every story -- sometimes three\" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor.  The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped.  Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. Harris won two awards.  The show went on without the self-proclaimed \"King of the South,\" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest.  Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, \"including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console.\"  At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet.  \"Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,\" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.  \"The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns.\"  The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement.  The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said.  The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said.  On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said.  Harris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said.  Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation.  \"Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,\" according to an affidavit.  Harris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as \"trap musik,\" the name of Harris' second album. A \"trap\" is Southern slang for a drug house.  Harris soon will appear in the movie \"American Gangster,\" starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. The film is set to open November 2.

Starting Thursday, an all-male \"crew\" of six -- three Russians, a Frenchman, an Italian-Colombian and a Chinese -- will spend 520 days in the cramped and claustrophobic conditions of a special facility in Moscow and will follow a strict regimen of exercise and diet.      Organizers at the European Space Agency and Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems hope the project will shed light on the physical and psychological effects of the long isolation that future Mars astronauts will experience.      \"This study is not useful only for Mars, but also for life on Earth,\" 27-year-old Diego Urbina, the Italian-Colombian participant, said in a news release.      The researchers will communicate with mission control via the internet, with occasional disruptions and a 20-minute delay to imitate the effects of space travel.      They will perform tasks similar to astronauts at the international space station, such as maintenance and scientific experiments, but for a longer period of time. They will follow a seven-day week with two days off, except when special and emergency situations are simulated.      The latest isolation test is the last and longest part of the Mars500 experiment that began in 2007. The first phase was a 14-day simulation that mainly tested the facilities and operational procedures. The second phase followed in 2009, when four Russian and two European crew members were shut into the facility for 105 days.      Missions to the Red Planet have thus far been unmanned. In January, NASA told CNN Radio that the agency was close to a deal to merge its Mars program with the European Space Agency's, a big step toward manned missions.

He is covered with bandages; a ventilator breathes for Michael Brewer because he can't do it for himself.    He's hooked up to the marvels of modern medicine that are trying to give the 15-year-old burn victim a chance to be a kid once again.    Sixty-five percent of his body is covered with second- and third-degree burns.    \"People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about,\" said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami.    \"I've been to movies like everyone else, and Hollywood hasn't even thought of something like this,\" Namias said.    Brewer is heavily sedated, and the ventilator does not allow him to speak. His open wounds are covered by bandages, which are changed daily. It's a four-hour process.    He has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began October 12, when police say five teenage friends, including a 13-year-old, doused Brewer with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire.    The attack occurred after Brewer reported to police that one of the youths had stolen his father's bicycle. Police say the bicycle was stolen because Brewer did not pay one of the boys $40 for a video game.    According to police, witnesses said the teens called Brewer \"a snitch\" as they used a lighter to set him ablaze.    Namias explained how Brewer's organs are not functioning the way they should be, but that is expected at this early stage of recovery.    \"He's still on the ventilator and advanced modes of mechanical ventilation. We are breathing for him. His contribution to the breathing is trivial,\" Namias said.    Namias also explained that in burn cases, words must be chosen carefully when talking about patients and their condition because so much is at risk and so much can change quickly.    \"When you say he's doing OK, in this situation it means he's alive and responding to treatments,\" Namias said. \"We're still dealing with the respiratory failure. We're dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive.\"    On Monday, the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in Broward County, Florida.    State prosecutors were granted additional time to build their case. Formal charges are expected later this month. For now, all five teens are being held in custody.    Four of the boys, all 15 years old, could be charged as adults. The 13-year-old also could be charged as an adult but under Florida law only if Brewer dies.    Michael Brewer's parents, Valerie and Michael Brewer Sr., issued a written statement through the hospital last week. They are not granting interviews.    \"The recovery process will be baby steps, but eventually he will be whole again,\" they wrote.    But their son's injuries enter the realm of medicine and science that has no guarantee.    \"There's no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn,\" Namias said.    \"Surviving is a miracle of modern medicine and about the technology and the things we do. This is not like a gunshot and you come out of the [operating room], and say everything's going to be OK,\" he added.    \"We never give up, and we never predict it. ... Our expectation is survival.\"    Across the hospital floor in the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital, six other people's lives also are at stake: all victims of various accidents, all with burns similar to Michael Brewer's. They, too, are trying to regain at least a part of what they used to have.    \"It's understandable that people can be burned in accidents,\" Namias said.    \"But this was no accident.

WOODLAND HILLS, California (CNN) -- Youssif happily pulls off his plastic face mask and pats his cheeks, which were once covered by horrific burns.    \"No hurt,\" the 5-year-old Iraqi boy says in English. \"No hurt.\"    He then shows off his right hand. It too had been marred by hardened scar tissue after he was attacked by masked men outside his central Baghdad home January 15, 2007. Now, his hand is smooth.   Youssif flashes a proud grin.

He points at the name \"Youssif\" and then covers the final four letters.    \"You,\" he says.    Youssif began attending an American school just last month, one year to the day after he was so savagely attacked in Baghdad. In a recent letter to those who have helped his son, Youssif's father described the anniversary as a \"very hard day\" to endure but one that also brought joy.    \"But this year, it was the day for another miracle, Youssif's first day of kindergarten. It was a very happy day,\" Youssif's father said.    Youssif begins each day with his father strapping him into a bike trailer. Dad then pedals him to school.    On one recent outing, his dad's mobile phone blared Arabic music as Youssif quietly sat in the back, a helmet securely strapped to his head, the wind whirling past.    As soon as they reached the school, Youssif's slow walk away from his father, his head held down, quickly changed into a sprint toward his classroom, and all you could see was the big red \"S\" on his Superman backpack flying away.    \"Harry,\" Youssif says in a small, muffled tone, reading the writing on the dry-erase board after receiving a little help from some classmates seated on the rug.  Watch Youssif-inspired music video \u00bb    He then receives a congratulatory high-five from one of his kindergarten teachers.    Youssif is adjusting well to school, able to write out the alphabet and count to 12 without hesitation. He always finishes with an accomplished sigh, wide eyes and a smile so big, it's as if he is making up for the 10 months he was not able to smile.    He is quick to show the pencil box on his desk, pointing to his name written on it and then pointing to himself with the same tiny finger and nodding his head, letting you know that it is his.    \"The kids love Youssif. They get more excited than he does when he learns a new word in English, and they brag about it for hours,\" the mother of a classmate says.    Youssif is attending the school thanks to help from the Children's Burn Foundation, the Grossman Burn Center and hundreds of thousands of dollars donated by you, the CNN.com user, to help bring him and his family to the United States for treatment.    Youssif has undergone more than half a dozen surgeries. One removed the most massive scarring, which stretched about half a foot, from one of his ears to below his chin.  See how doctors removed Youssif's scars \u00bb    He could undergo as many as 12 more procedures, his doctors say, mostly to tweak scars. His right ear has swelled, and doctors are monitoring it to figure out the best way to keep it in check. He wears a clear plastic face mask for much of the day to keep his skin tight and to allow it to heal correctly.    But the young boy's transformation -- both in looks and in spirit -- is nothing short of remarkable.    Back at his apartment, Youssif peels a clementine. He uses exaggerated motions as he plops each section in his mouth. At one point, he places his hand on his hip and taps his foot, waiting for an acknowledgment of this feat.    When he came to America in September, he couldn't eat -- or at least not like this. He smiles again.    \"Now, Youssif eats anything he wants, because he can open and close his mouth,\" his father said in the letter. \"I have begun to see my son's lively spirit return. The surgeries have removed more than just external scars, they are also beginning to remove his internal scars.    \"A few weeks ago we went to the park and Youssif rode on the merry-go-round.

In an e-mail to the McCain campaign, Opinion Page Editor David Shipley said he could not accept the piece as written, but would be \"pleased, though, to look at another draft.\"    \"Let me suggest an approach,\" he wrote Friday. \"The Obama piece worked for me because it offered new information (it appeared before his speech); while Senator Obama discussed Senator McCain, he also went into detail about his own plans. It would be terrific to have an article from Senator McCain that mirrors Senator Obama's piece.\" Read McCain's rejected piece    In a statement released Monday, The New York Times said it is \"standard procedure on our Op-Ed page, and that of other newspapers, to go back and forth with an author on his or her submission.\"    \"We look forward to publishing Senator McCain's views in our paper just as we have in the past. We have published at least seven Op-Ed pieces by Senator McCain since 1996. The New York Times endorsed Senator McCain as the Republican candidate in the presidential primaries. We take his views very seriously,\" the statement said.    McCain's rejected op-ed was a lengthy critique of Obama's positions on Iraq policy, particularly his view of the surge.    \"Senator Obama seems to have learned nothing from recent history,\" wrote McCain, criticizing Obama's call for an early withdrawal timeline. \"I find it ironic that he is emulating the worst mistake of the Bush administration by waving the 'Mission Accomplished' banner prematurely.\"  Watch why the piece was rejected \u00bb    Obama's July 14 essay had taken shots at McCain for not further encouraging the Iraqi government to take control of the country.    \"Instead of seizing the moment and encouraging Iraqis to step up, the Bush administration and Senator McCain are refusing to embrace this transition -- despite their previous commitments to respect the will of Iraq's sovereign government,\" Obama wrote in his op-ed.    \"They call any timetable for the removal of American troops 'surrender,' even though we would be turning Iraq over to a sovereign Iraqi government.\" Read Obama's essay    Shipley, who was President Bill Clinton's senior speechwriter from 1995 to 1997, had advised the McCain campaign that \"the article would have to articulate, in concrete terms, how Senator McCain defines victory in Iraq.    \"It would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory -- with troops levels, timetables and measures for compelling the Iraqis to cooperate. And it would need to describe the senator's Afghanistan strategy, spelling out how it meshes with his Iraq plan.\"    He added that he hoped the parties could \"find a way to bring this to a happy resolution.\"    McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Monday the Arizona senator's position will not change based on the \"demands of the New York Times.\"    \"John McCain believes that victory in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables,\" he said. \"Unlike Barack Obama, that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the New York Times.\"    The newspaper endorsed McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in January, shortly before the New York primary.    In February, after it became clear McCain would be his party's presumptive nominee, the paper published a thinly sourced report that McCain once had a close relationship with a female lobbyist.    McCain said he was disappointed in the New York Times piece. The paper said that it stood by its reporting and that \"the story speaks for itself.\"    McCain's campaign sent out fundraising appeals based on the article.

Now, he's not only able to walk, but his newfound independence has made it possible for him to move to another town where he could find work.    \"He lifted me up to where I am today,\" Morales says.    Morales isn't the only person in southeastern Mexico who credits Puckett with changing his life. Since November 2000, the certified, licensed prosthetist/orthotist from Savannah, Georgia, has been providing artificial limbs, orthopedic braces and ongoing care to hundreds in need in the communities of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and Chiapas -- free of charge.    \"When someone loses a limb they immediately know what they've lost,\" says Puckett. \"The goal is to restore the healthy self image again so that that person can see themselves whole.\"    Puckett first connected with the Yucatan people while volunteering on a mission there as a teenager. Struck by the overwhelming poverty and the physical challenges he saw people facing in the rural communities, Puckett vowed to return and make a difference there.    \"When I finally got into the field of orthotics and prosthetics, I said, 'Ah-ha. Now, I know what I can do.' \"    His nonprofit, PIPO Missions: Limbs and Braces to Mexico, collects donated, used orthopedic braces and artificial limbs in the United States and crafts new ones from their recycled components. On average, Puckett makes a six-day trip every two months to distribute the custom prosthetics and braces, while also providing ongoing care.    \"To deliver an artificial limb or brace without follow-up doesn't help that person in the long run,\" says Puckett. \"We need to make sure that they have what they need to continue living successfully for years to come.\"    Over the course of his 41 trips to the region, Puckett has helped more than 420 individuals. He's found that word of his work spreads fast through the villages and people will drive hours to attend his clinics. Puckett's trips are routinely extended to accommodate house calls to immobile residents of distant towns.  Watch how Puckett brings prosthetic and orthotic care to people in Mexico \u00bb    \"Someone might say, 'I wanna bring 10 people with me next time you come.' The mixed blessing is they'll bring 50 or 100 people that have physical needs,\" says Puckett. \"The difficulty for me is, how do I say no?\"    For Puckett, each trip demonstrates the immeasurable impact he is making on people's lives. Stories of previously unimagined independence, confidence and employment greet him from clinical waiting areas, often along with offerings of food, livestock and friendship. When his group helps one person, Puckett explains, it has an effect on an entire community.  Watch Puckett describe how one patient in Mexico crafted himself a homemade foot \u00bb    \"It opens a whole other door for many of these folks to experience the world in a way in which they've never even dreamt of,\" says Puckett. \"And the world has an opportunity to greet them, accept them and welcome them back into society. So, it's a double blessing.\"  Watch Puckett describe how he helped a woman now known as \"the miracle girl\" \u00bb    In between trips, Puckett also spends time soliciting the aid of surgeons, as he frequently encounters physical conditions that require surgery before prosthetic help can be successfully administered.    \"If we had a surgeon here, we could see eight to 10 patients in a weekend and change their lives forever,\" he says. \"It's tough for people to make the choice to give up time with their families and a portion of their income to extend themselves in this way. But, take it from me, the more we give, the more we get.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/d09e2a84197b6e9a61a7d985e32d75ccc8207474.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what does the recall involve", "id": "108492", "answers": [{"text": "certain GM vehicles in which oil apparently can leak and ignite.", "answer_start": 241}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The possibility of engine fires has prompted General Motors to recall nearly 1.5 million passenger sedans manufactured between 1997 and 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Monday.  The recall involves certain GM vehicles in which oil apparently can leak and ignite.  The recall covers certain mid- and full-size passenger sedans under GM's Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac brands.  The affected vehicles have naturally aspirated 3.8 liter V6 engines -- that is, engines that use atmospheric pressure rather than a mechanical blower to bring in air for combustion -- according to documents that GM filed with federal regulators last week.  On Friday, the federal government acknowledged the filing and agreed to the plan.  The problem involves a potential for oil to leak on the exhaust manifold during hard braking. When a car operates under normal conditions, the manifold can get very hot.  Oil that runs below the manifold's heat shield could ignite and spread to plastic channels that hold spark plug wires.  As a solution, the company recommends a change in the bracket that holds spark plug wires, which will be done free of charge.  Owners and dealers affected by the recall will be notified by letter next month with details.  The vehicles involved are: \u2022 1997-2003 Buick Regals. \u2022 1998-2003 Chevrolet Luminas, Monte Carlos and Impalas. \u2022 1998-1999 Oldsmobile Intrigues. \u2022 1997-2003 Pontiac Grand Prix.  GM issued a recall on a similar engine in 2008, according to the company's filing with the government.

White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel carries fly-fishing tackle  to Marine One on Friday.    Fly-fishing requires a singular focus, much like golf. Having newly discovered the sport myself, it occurred to me as I watched Marine One lift off the South Lawn on Friday that there are probably some lessons on the river that could apply to Obama's presidency.    Thinking like a producer, I called an expert -- fly-fishing instructor Tony Derosier, who described the evolution most fishermen go through.    \"Usually, when you first go fishing, all you want to do is catch a fish, and then all you want to do is catch a lot of fish, and then you just want to catch the larger fish. After you've caught a lot of large fish, you kind of go back to square one and catch just one fish,\" said Derosier, manager at Taylor Creek Fly Shop in Aspen, Colorado. \"You basically just want to go fishing -- the numbers, the size, it doesn't matter any more.\"    Obama is in the \"big fish\" stage of his presidency: He's trying to get health-care reform legislation passed hook, line, and sinker. If he's successful, anything else he gets passed will be icing on the cake.    Learning the fundamentals of fly-fishing can serve as a metaphor for health care reform. Obama just needs to look at hooking and landing Blue Dog Democrats and Republicans like he would trout.    The first step -- learn how to cast. \"Fly-casting is all about maximizing the energy you put in your rod and you lose energy if you wait too long,\" Derosier said. \"And conversely, if you don't wait long enough, your line will crack like a whip.\" Obama has to strike the right balance between rushing things through and losing momentum; and maintaining support while bringing others over to his side.    The second step -- reading the water: \"Instead of blindly casting anywhere in the river you want to understand where you might find fish,\" Derosier explained. Obama zeroed in on a fairly conservative state, Montana, where he faces a land full of skeptics about his health care reform plan.    Third -- hook and land the fish: Derosier said once you hook the fish you have to know how to play the fish, which is a delicate balance between applying pressure but not so much that the line breaks -- much like the delicate balance of Obama's courting members of Congress.    \"The ultimate goal is to gain an advantage over the fish so that you can land him,\" he said. \"It's the hardest thing to teach when it comes to fly-fishing,\" he said.    Out in Montana, the game is catch-and-release trout. But in Washington, Obama is trying to hook Congress and take home health care reform, or risk it being the big one that got away."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4115c7fc9241f25284e7c4424eeff51d86be0496.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is there any hoping to find more gorillas?", "id": "108498", "answers": [{"text": "officials hope that", "answer_start": 658}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The mountain gorillas in a national park in Congo appear to be hanging on well despite such dangers as civil warfare and poaching, according to an ongoing census.

Jeremiah Wright on Monday said the black church, not him, had been subjected to attacks in the 2008 presidential campaign.    Speaking before the National Press Club, Sen. Barack Obama's former pastor sought to give insight into the black church and clarify some of his remarks that have sparked a firestorm.    Earlier this year, some of Wright's sermons, circulated and widely discussed on the Internet and on television, became an issue in the Democratic presidential race because of the former pastor's ties to Obama.    Wright is a retired pastor from the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, Illinois, where Obama worships.    In one sermon, Wright said the U.S. had brought the September 11 attacks upon itself and said \"America's chickens are coming home to roost.\"    Asked to explain those remarks, Wright said, \"Have you heard the whole sermon? ... No, you haven't heard the whole sermon.

He had to distance himself, because he's a politician, from what the media was saying I had said, which was un-American.\"    Obama, when asked what he could do to keep Wright's latest comments from dragging him down, replied:    \"I think people will understand that I am not perfect and that there are going to be folks in my past like Rev. Wright that may cause them some concern -- but that ultimately, my 20 years of service and the values that I've written about and spoken about and promoted are their values and what they're concerned about. And that's what this camp has been about and what it's going to continue to be about.\"    Wright said sound bites from his sermons were taken out of context and said the black religious tradition, despite its long history, is in some ways \"invisible to the dominant culture.\"    The theology of the black church is a \"theology of liberation, it is a theology of transformation and it is ultimately a theology of reconciliation,\" he said.    Wright's remarks came a day after he addressed an audience of 10,000 at a dinner sponsored by the Detroit chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Watch as Wright answers his critics at the NAACP event \u00bb    Reiterating some of the same points from that dinner, Wright said, \"Being different does not mean one is deficient -- it simply means one is different, like snowflakes.\"    Wright said reconciliation means \"we embrace our individual rich histories.\"    He said it also means rooting out \"any teaching of superiority, inferiority, hatred or prejudice\" and recognizing that each person \"is one of God's children ... no better, no worse.\"    \"Only then will liberation, transformation and reconciliation become realities and cease being ever-elusive ideals,\" he said.    At the height of the Wright controversy, Obama gave a speech on race relations, rejecting his ex-pastor's controversial comments but saying he could not repudiate the man himself.    \"I'm not here for political reasons,\" Wright said Sunday. \"I am not a politician. I know that fact will surprise many of you because many in the corporate-owned media have made it seem as if I had announced that I'm running for the Oval Office.

A Cabinet statement on Monday said it had directed authorities in Salaheddin province and the Education Ministry to \"take all necessary measures\" to prevent such outings.    The former dictator, along with his two sons and other relatives, is buried in his hometown of al-Ouja near Tikrit in Salaheddin north of Baghdad.

So, many of them rely on a group of hardy volunteer drivers for transport.      Adrian Stanton was running Virginia Hospital Center's command center Wednesday morning, coordinating the driver pickups and drop-offs. He described the volunteer drivers as \"unbelievable saviors for us.\"      One of those volunteers is Scott Long, who left his home at 6 a.m. to pick up two nurses before heading to the hospital, where he picked up another nurse to take her home. Long initially said he does it because he thinks it's the right thing to do. But he later admitted he also does it because it he enjoys it.      \"My wife can stay with the kids. I get to play in the snow and nobody can yell at me for being out driving in the snow,\" he told CNN.      \"I had a police officer the first day pull up at a stoplight and yell at me for being on the road. I told him I was driving for the hospital and he laughed and said, 'Well then, have fun.'\"      Long drives a 1995 Jeep Wrangler for his pick-ups. He says he likes the Jeep better than his four-wheel drive.      \"The reason is the short wheel base. I can actually turn around in a single lane in traffic, whereas if I had my bigger four-wheel drive, it doesn't turn around and it's not as nimble,\" he said.      As Long was making that point, his Jeep started sliding sideways along the road. But he didn't miss a beat as he regained control.      \"Like where we just slid out there, the Jeep can handle it better than the truck,\" he said.      The volunteer drivers are offered a gas voucher from the hospital, but Stanton said most of them turn it down. Stanton has an active list of about 30 people who drive for the hospital during inclement weather. Wednesday morning he said the drivers had done somewhere near 50 pick-ups and drop-offs in the previous 24 hours.      The hospital workers appreciate the volunteer drivers.      \"I didn't have any other options,\" said James Schmidt. He heard about the rides from e-mails and texts that the hospital sent to its employees.      One intensive-care nurse said she had driven herself to work the past few days. \"I don't know how I made it,\" she said, adding, \"God bless\" the drivers.      One night-shift supervisor named Lynne said she received a ride from Long on Thursday morning. She lives only a few miles from the hospital, but didn't think she would be able to make it home in the snow.      Lynne said, \"This is worse than ...\"      Long finished her sentence: \"... anything so far.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/d845d4c12b8b9cf42e31da2a905439d0dcdcca3b.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What business did a man start?", "id": "108516", "answers": [{"text": "SFG Records.", "answer_start": 3292}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Editor's note: CNN affiliates report on where job seekers are finding work across the country and how those looking for employment are coping with the situation.

John McCain,", "answer_start": 2942}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Hanford Nuclear Site, Washington (CNN) -- The federal government has set aside nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington state's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, once the center of the country's Cold War plutonium production.      That is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received, which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent.      The facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south-central Washington, an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island. It was built in the 1940s as part of the \"Manhattan Project\" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II.      Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built.      During the Cold War, Hanford became a main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program.      Decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being one of the most contaminated nuclear sites in the Western Hemisphere.      Today, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town, and those involved in the cleanup say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds.      There are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge.      The stimulus money will reduce the cleanup time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford.      \"It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,\" Peschong said. \"Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the cleanup footprint much sooner, years sooner.\"      The money has also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time.      \"I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,\" Gill said. \"We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get.\"      Hanford won't be decontaminated quickly. The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear. They break down contaminated equipment through a \"glove box,\" allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves. Each time a worker removes the gloves, a colleague must check for radiation exposure.      The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. A report by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted.      The Hanford cleanup \"has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress,\" according to the report.      Gerry Pollet, who runs a Hanford watchdog organization, says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste. But he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed.      \"You are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the cleanup and the environment,\" said Pollet, who heads Heart of America Northwest. \"They are picking the low-hanging fruit, the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities. But that doesn't cost $2 billion.      \"Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds, and you would expect to see real progress for cleanup [to] happen with those dollars.\"      While debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used, the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland, Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the cleanup boom.      Hanford began receiving stimulus dollars in March 2009, which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn.      The Tri-Cities area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Washington, and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn, according to the Tri-Cities Industrial Development Council.      Ken Brutzman, who owns a local office furniture store, said his business was \"at a standstill\" last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in. Brutzman had to hire six temporary workers, two of which he may keep on full time, to deal with the boom in business.      \"We are on track to have the best year ever,\" Brutzman said. His business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable since the Hanford cleanup project is expected to take another 40 years.      \"It has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying, 'Wow how does that guy do that?'\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/b290fdb4d984a16a1e958e852b4bf283cb9f5b1a.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What do Federal authorities plan to unseal on Monday?", "id": "108525", "answers": [{"text": "charges", "answer_start": 44}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Federal authorities plan to unseal charges Monday against several people arrested in a series of weekend raids in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, prosecutors in Detroit said Sunday.

Gina Balaya, spokeswoman for the U.S attorney's office in Detroit, said those charges will be revealed during a federal court hearing Monday.      Mike Lackomar, a county leader for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, said the target of the raid was a Christian militia group called the Hutaree.

Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera made the statement Saturday as the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo defended the martial law declaration, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. Some lawmakers have challenged the legality of the declaration, which allows authorities to make arrests without a warrant.    Martial law went into effect Friday night in the province of Maguindanao to impose peace following the politically motivated massacre, said army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. He added that Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days.    Police and military reports of armed men massing in Maguindanao would lead to charges of rebellion, Devanadera said, according to ABS-CBN.    Signs indicated that \"violence was imminent,\" said Brig. Gen. Gaudencio Pangilinan, operations chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the affiliate reported.    The armed men were supporters of the politically powerful Ampatuan family, which has been implicated in the massacre, Pangilinan said.    At least six members of the Ampatuan family have been arrested, including Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr., according to ABS-CBN. Ampatuan, whose father is governor of Maguindanao, has been accused of directing the killings and has been charged with 25 counts of murder.    One of the massacre victims implicated members of the Ampatuan family before she died, the affiliate reported.    Over the weekend, authorities raided at least one warehouse and ranch belonging to the family. They confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindinao command, told CNN.    The military was looking at arresting at least 100 people tied to the massacre, ABS-CBN reported. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said.    Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities \"were trying to build a case, a tight case\" against suspects.    \"But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law.\"    The president was to submit a written report to Congress on Sunday evening, justifying her declaration of martial law, the Department of Justice said, according to the state-run Philippine News Agency.    Political debate had flared over how soon Congress needed to convene after the declaration of martial law, as required by the Constitution.    The House of Representatives and the Senate might jointly convene on Tuesday to discuss the president's report, House Speaker Prospero Nograles said Sunday, according to the Philippine News Agency.    Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the country. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media.    The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael \"Toto\" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself.    Ampatuan Sr. has been taken into custody in the massacre, but was hospitalized after taking ill.    Witnesses and local officials say the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging the younger Ampatuan -- a longtime ally of the Philippine president and a known warlord -- in the May gubernatorial election.    A dozen journalists who had accompanied the women were also killed in the massacre.    Group: Philippines most dangerous country for journalists    Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims.    Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/36917d73735a371e9715bd54133123ea0c632060.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "who suffers at a higher rate?", "id": "108532", "answers": [{"text": "women are nearly twice as likely", "answer_start": 1377}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- For the first 45 of her 50 years of living, Bonnie Neighbour used to wake up feeling sorry to be alive.    Bonnie Neighbour has struggled with mental health issues for almost all of her 50 years.    \"Even when I wasn't actually depressed, I would open my eyes in the morning and wonder if there wasn't something else; I would have preferred an alternative to being alive,\" she says.    She recalls being depressed as a young child. In her late teens, she started having mood problems that eventually escalated into clinical depression.    \"At some point, I was suicidal. I would suffer cycles of depression and mania,\" Neighbour said. \"I wouldn't sleep for days, and the less sleep I would get, the more revved up I'd become, and then I would make irrational decisions and act out. Then I'd alternate with serious depressive episodes.    \"At one time, for nine months, I wasn't even able to leave the house [because of depression].\" At age 30, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.    Neighbour's story isn't uncommon.    \"Action Steps for Improving Women's Mental Health,\" a new report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office on Women's Health (OWH), explores the role gender plays in the diagnosis, course and treatment of mental illness. It calls for specific actions to counteract the inadequacies in this field.    According to the report, women are nearly twice as likely as men to suffer from major depression. They are three times as likely to attempt suicide, and they experience anxiety disorders two to three times more often than men.  Chart: Gender and mental health \u00bb    While these statistics are not new, their importance is generally underplayed, says Wanda Jones, Dr.P.H., health scientist and director of the OWH. She notes that whereas past reports have focused on bringing mental health to the forefront of concern -- such as the 1999 publication \"Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General\" -- few have focused primarily on the specific mental illness issues specific to women, hence the need for such a publication.    Among the actions recommended by the new report are the needs to underscore the essential importance of women's mental health to overall well-being, improve how primary care doctors and mental health professionals interface with each other, develop a greater understanding in the role of gender in mental illness,  recognize the role of trauma and violence against women and its subsequent impact on mental illness and address cultural biases that serve as barriers to treatment for many women.    Reasons for the gender disparities in mental health are still unclear, according to Jones. Part of the difference is based on biology. Female hormones, thyroid disease and brain biochemistry have all been cited as possible reasons. Genetics also play a part, as family history has proven that mental illness repeats itself across multiple generations. Socio-cultural reasons also contribute to the difference.    Jones stresses that the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to diagnosing and treating mental illness is not an effective approach and that acknowledging the gender differential is key to adequately and appropriately treating women.    The new report also underscores the relative young age at which mental illness often sets in for both males and females. Half of all mental illnesses occur before age 14, and three-fourths occur by the age of 24, according to the publication. Among the more common mental illnesses seen among young women: eating disorders, which can start in advance of puberty and yet last a lifetime.    Jones emphasizes the dire need for early detection and treatment of mental illnesses in young women. \"When these young people grow into adults, they're more likely to end up in the criminal justice system, homeless on the streets, poor performers in school and ultimately bounced into a system that's incapable of helping them with their needs,\" she explains.    Another point Jones stresses is about the negative stigma around women's mental health issues. \"We have to accept that mental illness is not a sign of weakness; it's not a choice. But it is treatable, and our own innate resilience protects us and plays a critical role in combating mental illness, especially depression and anxiety,\" she says.    Despite the relief Neighbour initially felt after finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she recalls that instead of getting better, she started to get worse. The mood-stabilizing medications she was prescribed were so sedating that she slept 16 hours a day, which led her deeper into her depression. \"The doctor said, 'This is how things are, and it will only get worse,' and that's what I started to believe. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" she says.    There is a common thread to Neighbour's experience and that of other women suffering from mental illness: societal beliefs often pressure women into accepting their mental illness as \"just how things are,\" citing hormones and traditional views of women as the emotional, weaker sex as reasons to simply accept their current situation. According to Jones, it's a barrier that keeps women from seeking treatment for an otherwise largely treatable disease.    Despite numerous barriers to access and adequate mental health treatment for women, recent developments in female-specific care provide a new area of hope. Over the last decade, researchers have begun to develop trauma-informed care services, which focus on the high prevalence of trauma -- such as childhood sexual abuse, relationship violence and coerced sex -- that women are more likely to have experienced compared to men. The HHS reports that 40 percent of women report a history of sexual violence, compared to only 10 percent of men. In some mental health treatment programs, recognizing these underlying factors and treating women accordingly has led to dramatically improved outcomes.    In 2005, Neighbour discovered the concept of mental health recovery, which is focused on identifying triggers and symptoms that would cause her behavior to get worse, and responding with actions that she recognized helped her calm herself.

In a news conference Monday at the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said out of about 100 pregnant women who participated in trial studies, over 90 percent showed a robust immune response to a single 15-microgram dose of the H1N1 vaccine. And at this point, there have been no reported side effects, Fauci said.    Fauci stressed that these results should be reassuring for already-vaccinated pregnant women and this is \"vital information for those who have not yet been vaccinated.\" He added that \"pregnant women have tolerated the vaccine well, and no safety concerns have arisen.\"    Pregnant women are considered to be among the highest at risk for serious complications of this new flu strain. Since H1N1, also known as swine flu, first emerged in April, 28 pregnant women reportedly have died from complications of this flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).    Despite health officials repeatedly saying the H1N1 vaccine is safe, questions about it persist. To reassure those who question the safety of the vaccine, Dr. Bruce Gellin, director of the National Vaccine Program Office, noted that a new independent panel has been formed to review data from all sources on the safety of the vaccine.    The group will monitor all sources reporting problems with the vaccine.    \"The vast amount of adverse events have been minor,\" said Gellin. He said there has been one reported death linked to the vaccine, but further investigation showed that the person died from the actual H1N1 flu, not the vaccine. Gellin said the panel was designed to keep an eye on any possible negative consequences and report them immediately.    According to Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, who also attended the news conference, 30 million doses of the vaccine are available for states to order.    She explained that that does not mean 30 million shots are available to the public at this point. The vaccines need to be ordered by each state and distributed before they make it to doctor's offices and clinics.    Schuchat reassured the public that more vaccines would be made available within the next few weeks, as demand for shots continues to rise.    Fauci also noted further studies on children -- youngsters between the ages of 6 months to 35 months, and children from the age of 3 years to 9 years -- found they responded much better to two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine, than one single dose.    For children 9 and older, a single 15-microgram dose gave young people a robust immune reaction that should protect them against the virus.    When asked how this H1N1 virus differed from the seasonal flu, Schuchat said they were at opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to high-risk patients.    \"With seasonal flu,\" said Schuchat, \"Ninety percent of the deaths every year are in people over the age of 65.\" She noted, \"But with H1N1, 90 percent of the deaths, thus far, have been in people under the age of 65.\"    And she added, \"half of those are under the age of 25 years, in young people. So those are the people we want to get our message to. Children, pregnant women, young people should be getting vaccinated.\"    Fauci agreed saying, \"You need to look at the risk ... Right now, the risk of becoming seriously ill, even dying from this virus, outweighs the risk of something happening to you if you take the vaccine. It's really that simple.\"    CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9e28e9ff2d1f14eb8f6410ee19c5ad92cca39311.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When did two copters collide?", "id": "108548", "answers": [{"text": "Monday,", "answer_start": 96}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Fourteen Americans died in two helicopter crashes in Afghanistan on Monday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said: 10 in one incident and four in the other.    Three Drug Enforcement Administration special agents were among the dead, according to the DEA, which did not identify them.    The agents were first DEA agents to be killed in Afghanistan.    \"Like all those who give their lives in service to America, they were doing their duty, and they were doing this nation proud,\" President Obama said at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida.    \"Now, it is our duty, as a nation, to keep their memory alive in our hearts and to carry on their work, to take care of their families, to keep our country safe,\" Obama said.    It was the largest number of Americans killed in Afghanistan in a single day in more than four years, according to CNN records.

A helicopter went down in the west of the country after a raid on suspected drug traffickers. Seven U.S. service members and three U.S. civilians were killed, according to an ISAF statement. Fourteen Afghan service members, 11 U.S. service members and one U.S. civilian were injured in the crash.    Monday's crash marked the second-deadliest incident in the agency's 36-year history, according to entries on the DEA's Web site.    The deadliest incident for the DEA occurred August 27, 1994, when a plane carrying five special agents crashed in the Peruvian Andes during a reconnaissance mission, according to the DEA's Web site.    One of Monday's helicopter crashes occurred after the helicopter was returning from a raid on a compound, ISAF said.    The joint international security force killed more than a dozen enemy fighters while searching the compound, ISAF said. The site was thought to harbor insurgents tied to narcotics trafficking in western Afghanistan.    The militants were killed in a firefight when insurgents confronted the joint force.    As the force was leaving, a helicopter \"went down due to unconfirmed reasons,\" ISAF said. A recovery operation was launched.    DEA Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart said the crash occurred as the agents and seven U.S. service members were returning \"from a completed, joint counternarcotics mission.\"    \"DEA is an extremely tight family, and the death of these three brave agents is a devastating loss for us,\" she said in a written statement.    Attorney General Eric Holder said the circumstances of the crash were under investigation.    \"I want to express my deepest condolences to the families of these heroic agents,\" Holder said in a written statement.    \"During this difficult time, the families of these agents are foremost in our thoughts and prayers.\"    In Monday's other deadly crash, four U.S. service members were killed when two helicopters apparently collided in the air in southern Afghanistan. Two other NATO service members were injured.    \"The incident is currently being investigated, but it is confirmed that hostile fire was not involved,\" ISAF said.    \"Each and every death is a tremendous loss for the family and friends of each service member and civilian. Our grief is compounded when we have such a significant loss on one day,\" Col. Wayne Shanks, an ISAF spokesman, said in a written statement.    ISAF is not announcing the names of the dead or which branch of the service they were in, pending the notification of their relatives.    The DEA has had a presence in Afghanistan for four years.

Member of Sharjah royal family and one of Forbes' 100 most powerful women, Sheikha Lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of United Arab Emirates in 2004.  Her background is in IT and before the government appointment worked at the Dubai Ports Authority where she gained the \"Distinguished Government Employee Award\" in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes.  In 2000, Sheikha Lubna founded Tejari, the first Middle Eastern business-to-business marketplace. As a result of Tejari (Arabic for commerce) 70 percent of Dubai's government purchases are made online, while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch.  One of the cornerstones of Sheikha Lubna's work has been to allow for foreign ownership, so when John Defterios met up with her, he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy.  Sheikha Lubna: We are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors. We will evaluate each sector, from the service side, finance, accounting. And any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth, then we will focus on that: on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company.  Defterios: If you look at the Middle East, specifically within this Gulf region, it's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership. Is this society in the region ready for this move?  Sheikha Lubna: Interestingly, the United Arab Emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside. We host 200 nationalities, so for us, the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community. So in many ways I think the openness is only a natural path: it's an organic path to continue the openness that exists.  Foreign direct investment is not your own wealth. When you have your own wealth, you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes, because it's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure.  However, if you look at foreign direct investment, it mandates you to be much more transparent, you have to be very diligent about your work, and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment.  Defterios: It's interesting, you read the front line of the DP World, P&O acquisition and the furor it created in the United States particularly within Congress. What are the lessons, not just from the UAE perspective, but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process?  Sheikha Lubna: First of all, I think it is important to understand, in this global world, there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere. Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad. We've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad. And we've seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East, Australia, Asia as well as in Europe and the United States.  What's more important to understand is that if you're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that I don't want to sell to this particular organization versus another, there are other places.  Defterios: That's not a veiled message your saying, that's pretty forthright this comment.  Sheikha Lubna: But it's a message to all of us. If today I lock up my investment opportunity here, money will not come to me, money will go somewhere else. When I have investment coming from abroad, it creates confidence in this country that 'I am a global image'.  So when I say it, I am not directing this as a message to a particular country. I am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation, when it comes to responsibility, when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country. So that's really a lesson that's very very critical.  Defterios: A number of firsts: the first to start a B2B marketplace; the first female minister within the country, an economy minister; and the first to launch a perfume range as well. What is it all about? Trailblazing, setting examples, being an entrepreneur? How would you describe what you're doing here?  Sheikha Lubna: Everybody laughs about the perfume. One, I think the United Arab Emirates, since inception (it's not from today but from the founder late Sheikh Zayed) has always given equal opportunities for women. But it's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push, and what it is that we can do and not do.  In my personal belief you need a bridge, you need a door opener for women. And sometimes women do not want to take the risk. Sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving. I had the opportunity and I had the trust from the government and the community, so to me, it is setting the example internally for the young women, and men by the way. Be it in technology, or economy or e-commerce.  Defterios: And the perfume line is the exclamation point?  Sheikha Lubna: A young woman, actually a perfume creator, who sells exclusively to Saks Fifth Avenue in Dubai, decided to create a perfume with my name. So I had two mandates from her. One, I had to smell it, otherwise if it doesn't smell good I'm not going to take it as a name. So one, I had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume. And it's an Arabic perfume by the way.  And second, my mandate was that I would only launch it with my name for her, if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the Friends of Cancer Patients.

This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list.  Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home \u00bb  The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools.  Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked.  The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials.  Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago.  Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money.  \"We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,\" she says.  In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement.  Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: \"Five members.\"  Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce.  All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones.  \"It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,\" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. \"I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them.\"  He pauses: \"But you have to miss your country.\"  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan.  Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools.  Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms.  As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families.  The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records.  Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world.  Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them.  The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East.  \"Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,\" says Touqan, the education minister. \"We will not run a parallel system of education.\" E-mail to a friend"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/46150583888893136a77afc7e6a1e455b4e3f70e.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What do the posters call for?", "id": "108558", "answers": [{"text": "ban on the construction of minarets on mosques", "answer_start": 100}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Switzerland's largest city has permitted the use of controversial posters which call for a ban on the construction of minarets on mosques in the European country.    The Federal Commission against Racism said the posters defame Switzerland's peaceful Muslim population.    The posters are part of a campaign by the nationalist Swiss People's Party (SVP) and feature a veiled woman against a background of a Swiss flag pierced by several minarets resembling missiles.    The cities of Basel and Lausanne have described the posters as racist and banned them in publicly-owned spaces. However, Zurich is among a clutch of cities that have chosen not to prohibit them.    According to the SVP, the minarets symbolize ideological opposition to the country's constitution.    Switzerland will hold a national referendum on the issue on November 29.    According to Agence France-Presse, an opinion poll by the daily Tages-Anzeiger showed more than 51 percent of Swiss voters are against any ban on minaret construction.    The Swiss government and all the other major political parties are recommending a \"no\" vote, while local Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders have joined forces to reject a ban, AFP added.    The mayor of Zurich, Corine Mauch, told CNN that the decision on the poster was taken on the basis of political freedom of speech in the run-up to November's vote.    \"While we disapprove of the posters we took the decision after legal consultations.    \"We consulted the Federal Commission against Racism and spoke to Muslim communities in the city, but decided banning the posters from public spaces would draw more attention to the issue.\" Do you agree with the Zurich decision?    However, the Federal Commission against Racism said in a statement Wednesday that the posters \"defame Switzerland's peaceful Muslim population, feed prejudice, and portray the Muslim community as wanting to dominate Switzerland, oppress women and trample on fundamental rights.\"    The SVP have courted controversy with their campaigns in the past. In 2007 they faced international criticism for leading an anti-immigration campaign during the federal election that featured a poster with a white sheep kicking a black sheep off a Swiss flag.    Under party leader Christoph Blocher they went on to win the biggest share of the vote in the 200-member parliament, taking 55 seats.

But very few know of Ramin Ramezani, who was killed five days before Neda during last year's post-election demonstrations in the Iranian capital.      \"I always say Neda is the miracle of the century,\" Ramin's mother Zahra Ramezani told CNN by phone. \"Neda was destined to be known to everyone. If Ramin isn't known to everyone, that's OK.\"      Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's landslide re-election on June 12, 2009, had sparked the biggest protests in Iran since the 1979 revolution.      The following Monday, hundreds of thousands marched to Tehran's Azadi square, calling the vote a sham. Ramin was among the crowd. Watch YouTube video of the chaos that day      Ramin was on leave from military duty, back in Tehran to celebrate his 22nd birthday, just six days away. His parents told CNN that he had voted for Mir Hossein Moussavi, the opposition candidate who had energized young Iranians with promises of a freer society, more rights for women, and better relations with the West.      Around 6 p.m. that day, Ramin called his parents and told them not to worry, they said. He said he'd be home later that evening.      An hour later, just blocks away from Azadi square, violence erupted at a base for the Basij, Iran's pro-government militia. Protesters surrounded the building, shattered its windows with rocks, and set fire to several rooms.      Amateur video from the scene showed several armed members of the Basij on the rooftop apparently firing shots.      It was here, Ramin's parents said, that their son was killed. A single bullet entered the right side of his chest, tore through both his lungs and killed him within minutes, his parents said.      There was no way to know who fired the shot. It is widely believed that Ramin and several others who were killed on June 15 were the first casualties of the opposition movement's protests.      When Ramin didn't show up at home, the Ramezanis stayed up all night trying to reach him. Zahra Ramezani said she called Ramin's cell phone every hour but no one answered.      The following day they received a brief call from a man who did not identify himself.      \"He said, 'If you want your son's remains,' and as soon as he said 'remains' there was chaos in our home,\" said Zahra Ramezani. \"We were all hitting ourselves, screaming and shouting.\"      For Ramin's parents the nightmare was just beginning. Over the course of a week, they said they searched for Ramin's remains in five hospitals. They pleaded with officials at two courthouses and the interior ministry to help them find their son's body. Authorities said they would investigate.      Finally, at a prison morgue, a prison official showed Ramin's father the picture of his son's remains on a computer screen.      \"For about one hour I lost myself,\" Mehdi Ramezani said. \"I was hitting myself in the face and the head, asking, 'Why is my son's naked remains on this monitor?'\"      Mehdi Ramezani said an official at the prison morgue warned him to keep quiet about his son's death.      \"They made me promise them not to cause a big commotion during his funeral,\" Mehdi Ramezani said. \"They said it wouldn't be good for your future and the future of your children.\"      Calls to Iran's judiciary and security officials seeking comment were not returned.      Until now, Zahra and Mehdi Ramezani have never spoken to the international media. But after keeping silent for more than nine months, they still don't know any more about how their son died.      \"They still haven't told us anything,\" Zahra Ramezani said. \"They said, 'We didn't shoot him.' Then who shot him?\"      Human rights groups say around 80 people were killed during Iran's 2009 post-election protests, while Iran's government puts the number at about half of that. While Iran has charged prison officials with torturing to death some of those detained after the demonstrations, no one has been charged in any of the deaths during the protests.      Authorities in Iran have told CNN they are investigating the deaths, but the Ramezanis say they are losing hope.

President Obama is expected to announce Friday the creation of the position of \"cyber czar.\"    The czar will report to both the national security adviser and the head of the National Economic Council, the sources said.    Obama will not name anyone Friday to the post because the selection process is ongoing, they said.    In addition, the White House will release a 40-page report that sets broad goals for combating cyber intrusions, but does not spell out in detail how to do so, said the sources, who would not agree to be identified because the report has not been released.    Shortly after taking office, Obama ordered a 60-day review intended to ensure the federal government's cyber initiatives were \"appropriately integrated, resourced and coordinated with Congress and the private sector.\"    Melissa Hathaway, a senior member of the National Security Council who led the review process, told a security conference late last year that a public-private partnership and international alliances would be key to solving cyber security problems. Another senior official said any solution would be a \"team sport\" requiring a \"holistic, comprehensive\" approach.    Administration officials said that representatives of the private sector, government departments and agencies, academics, state and local officials and civil liberties and privacy experts were among those consulted during the review.    The Department of Homeland Security reports the number of cyber attacks on government and private networks increased from 4,095 in 2005 to 72,065 in 2008.    This month, a Transportation Department audit -- carried out after hackers got into a support system containing personnel records -- indicated the nation's air-traffic control system could be at risk.    Hathaway expressed concern that critical infrastructures such as the nation's power grid and financial networks could be vulnerable. \"God forbid if somebody were to take down and or manipulate our financial system, and what would we do, and would it make the current financial crisis look like a walk in the park?\" she asked.    Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair recently told reporters the biggest cyber threat facing the United States is from nation states, particularly Russia and China. \"I think China is winning the sweepstakes for the origin of most attacks on U.S. persons and organizations,\" he said.    The Bush administration's own review of the matter culminated in the mostly classified National Cybersecurity Initiative, which was enacted in January 2008. National Security Agency executive Sandra Stenar-Johnson said that plan consisted of 12 initiatives with three goals: reduce the current vulnerabilities in the system, defend against the full spectrum of threats, and develop next-generation technologies to maintain an edge over adversaries.    The Bush initiative tapped the Department of Homeland Security as the lead agency in the cyber battle. Senior officials in the Obama administration say the White House will anchor the latest effort, providing guidance and direction to ensure all agencies and departments are working well together."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/ab7b0a046836c640dcb1d270abedc8eb92da3d25.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did Jenkins sail the record breaking 202km/hours", "id": "108571", "answers": [{"text": "dry Lake Ivanpah near the border of California and Nevada", "answer_start": 357}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British man who has just claimed the world land sailing speed record is now planning to better his speed -- on ice.  Greenbird, driven by Briton Richard Jenkins has claimed the land sailing speed record  Using just wind power, Richard Jenkins drove his vehicle, the Greenbird, to 202 km/hour (126 miles/hour) in late March on the dry Lake Ivanpah near the border of California and Nevada in the western United States.  Greenbird is a carbon fibre composite craft -- described by the makers on their Web site as \"part airplane, part sailboat and part Formula One car\" -- that uses solid sails to harness the power of the wind.  It weighs 600 kg and is able to travel up to four or five times greater than the speed of the wind -- at which point the downward force of the wings increases the craft's weight to nearly a ton. The only metal in the structure is in the wing bearings and the wheel.  Jenkins told CNN the record came after the team, which is sponsored by UK-based green electricity company Ecotricity, made gains in all aspects of the vehicle's design.  \"It's a real mixture of everything -- all of the margins are so tight you have to make a little gain in every place.\"  The technologically advanced Greenbird works by using the flow of air over its vertical sail to push it forward. It transfers the side force of wind into downward energy to keep it from taking off -- a similar concept to that used in Formula One race cars.  Greenbird's record speed defeated the previous record set by American Bob Schumacher in 1999. Schumacher, in what he described as a \"boat\" called the \"Iron Duck,\" managed 116 miles per hour.  View a photo gallery of the successful speed record attempt \u00bb  Jenkins told CNN he had been working towards the record for about 10 years and was ecstatic to have managed the feat.  \"We had been working on this for a long time. It started when I was at university...so it was great to finally achieve the record.\"  The 32-year-old said bad weather and attracting sponsorship had been the main challenges in preparing to set the record.  \"You have to be very lucky for the weather to be right at the right time. For years I thought we were going to be unlucky.\"  With the land sailing record under his belt, Jenkins now plans to return to work on his Greenbird ice sailing craft -- which he feels has the potential to be even quicker than the Greenbird land racer.  \"Theoretically it should be a lot faster, but currently ice yachts are not as quick as land yachts. We are not completely sure why.\"  Jenkins said his next ice sailing attempt would likely take place in December this year on Canyon Ferry Lake in Montana, where the ice is large and secure enough for the vehicle.  It is also important to make attempts before snow falls on the ice, creating more drag, Jenkins added.  Ice sailing is significantly more risky than land sailing, he told CNN.  \"Depending on when you go, the ice can be a lot more unstable. There is the risk that you could go through a water-hole into the ice. We try not to think about it,\" Jenkins said.

Direct. In control. Loyal.    Jenny Sanford, here with her husband, was a Wall Street executive before she married Mark Sanford.    That's how friends describe Jenny Sanford, the wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who confessed to the nation in a rambling news conference that he was having an affair with a woman in Argentina.    Jenny Sanford, unlike so many wives of cheating politicians, was not there facing the cameras, standing beside her husband.    A reporter asked the governor if he and his wife of 20 years were separated.    \"I'm here, and she's there,\" he replied.    As romantic e-mails between her husband and his mistress were published by a local newspaper Thursday, the state's first lady, a former Wall Street executive, stayed far away from reporters. She was at the family's home on Sullivan's Island in South Carolina with her four sons and a few friends.    \"Don't you know that is what Jenny Sanford is about? That is what is authentic about Jenny Sanford. She is not going to humiliate herself by standing next to a story,\" said Cyndi Mosteller, a friend of the Sanfords since 1992 and the former first vice chairwoman of the South Carolina GOP.    \"She will stand next to Mark emotionally, but she cannot stand in the glare of others,\" Mosteller continued. \"She is out there taking a dignified road, one that is defined by principle, even if her heart might have difficulty following that principle. But her overriding priority is to protect her children.\"    Jenny Sanford released a lengthy statement late Wednesday making clear she had learned of her husband's infidelity before his recent secret trip to Buenos Aires. His whereabouts were a mystery for six days, leaving his family in the dark and creating a power vacuum and considerable confusion in the Capitol, with aides telling reporters he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail.    \"When I found out about my husband's infidelity I worked immediately to first seek reconciliation through forgiveness, and then to work diligently to repair our marriage,\" she wrote. \"We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity, self-respect, and my basic sense of right and wrong. I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago.    \"This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage. During this short separation it was agreed that Mark would not contact us. I kept this separation quiet out of respect of his public office and reputation, and in hopes of keeping our children from just this type of public exposure.\"    Mosteller's brother-in-law was with Jenny Sanford on Thursday as the e-mails penned to \"Maria\" became public. The messages from Mark Sanfordcompliment the woman on her \"tan lines\" and \"gentle kisses.\"    The e-mails were published by The State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina's capital, which said the governor's office confirmed they are authentic. When contacted by CNN, the governor's office would neither confirm nor deny their authenticity.    \"[The e-mails] are almost like reading a novel that you would embarrassed to buy,\" Mosteller said. \"To be one of his four children and know that is there for the world to see, it is incredible to all of us.\"    Jenny Sanford grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and earned a degree in finance from Georgetown University. She met Mark Sanford when they worked for investment firms in New York, she at Lazard Freres and he at Goldman Sachs. The two married and moved to his native South Carolina, and she managed his campaign for Congress in 1994.    \"Mark started out with five other opponents, and he didn't really have a shot. That was the opinion of most people,\" Mosteller said. \"But she and Mark worked together and turned that thing around so that candidate three, four and five ended up throwing their support behind him, and he won.\"    The two are equals intellectually, according to people who know them.    She went on to manage his gubernatorial campaign in 2002, turning her home into campaign headquarters.    Jenny Sanford was more than a visible first lady of South Carolina; she was involved in the finances of her husband's office to an extent that drew heated criticism from his opponents.    She also took a $70,000 deficit from the operations of the governor's mansion and put its finances into the black.    \"I pretty much am in his office in the mornings most days, and I do pretty much anything he wants me to do for him. I help to bridge the gap between things that have been commonplace themes in his life and make sure everybody in the office is on pace with his agenda,\" Jenny Sanford told Charleston's Post and Courier in June 2005.    The governor told the newspaper that his wife is \"particularly good with financial analysis [and] working with numbers.\"    She took up health as a key issue in her role as first lady, advocating nutrition, exercise and cancer prevention, serving on major boards and speaking at various functions to raise funds for disease research.    \"This is a classy woman who lacks pretension,\" Mosteller said. \"I took a road trip with her last year, and she just automatically got into the back seat.

But if he is telling the truth, there is something terribly disconcerting about the way the Washington \"scandal industrial complex\" -- full of reporters, former campaign workers and pundits -- has reacted to this sad story.      After the story broke in Politico, Cain the next day denied that he sexually harassed anyone, which after all, is the core issue. Since then, other anonymous sources claim they too were harassed, without anyone really knowing what the alleged harassment entailed. He has been consistent, unwavering and on the record in his denial.      But that's not good enough for the way things work in Washington, where the manner in which he reacted to the news is said to be a sign of whether he would make a good president. He is being assailed because he remembered more information and therefore \"his story changed,\" an unforgivable development for those who cover scandal news.      Journalists trotted out their well-worn formula for keeping a scandal story alive by saying that his \"answers led to more unanswered questions,\" even though he already answered the only question that matters -- did he harass anyone? Experts who know scandals decry his failure to have \"gotten ahead of the story.\" He should have seen this coming, they say, and pre-empted it, the way all clever Washington politicians, skilled in the art of survival, would have done.      My problem with this line of attack is it's exactly what has made politicians, and often the reporters who cover them, so disconnected from the rest of the country. Cain's reaction has been human. It's been just the opposite of what a politician who prizes political survival above all would have done.      Imagine that you were accused of doing something you did not do 12 years ago. You have a staff and your staff figured out a way to make it go away. Good, you might say. I didn't do it and it deserves to go away. You then put the issue out of your mind. Then 12 years later, the allegations re-emerge. It's not unnatural that you start to remember more facts. Some details come back to you. Some don't. That's the way the human mind works. It's not the way political minds work.      In a year in which people of all parties are fed up with how Washington conducts its business, it's ironic that Cain is now being assailed by Washington insiders for his failure to act like a Washington insider.      I know all the tricks of the trade. If Cain spent 21 years in Washington like I did, he would have pre-empted the issue by giving a speech about what it takes to make it in business.      As he cited his successes, he could have addressed how hard it can sometimes be to make it in America today. How innocent statements he once made to his staff led to threatened lawsuits. How despite his knowing he did nothing wrong, he was advised to \"settle\" the matter so it didn't become a bigger distraction. What's $35,000 to a multimillion dollar industry? Trial lawyers, excess regulations, union demands all make it so hard to create jobs and achieve growth. He could have gotten the news out himself, framed in a way that minimized the \"scandal\" and maximized his themes about the economy. How very Washington, and clever, that would have been.      If Cain was the same type of skilled politician who has made Washington what it is has largely become -- an assemblage of smooth-talking, gifted experts in creating a massive debt that risks our future, while being seemingly incapable of doing anything about it other than blaming the other guy -- he might have acted differently.      But he's not an insider. He said what came naturally. He remembered more facts -- a very human development -- and said them. Scandal experts will tell you not to remember more information. Stick to your denial and say nothing else, they would advise. Cain didn't do that because he's not like that. He genuinely is different. And because he's different, he's being pilloried for how he has handled the allegations.      Before these anonymous allegations hit, I publicly said, and I repeat, I like the fact that Cain is an outsider, but I don't think he's ready for the Oval Office. I wanted someone who thinks like an outsider but who has also served as a governor (think Indiana's Mitch Daniels) so he or she has the knowledge and experience to get programs through Congress. I'm neutral in this primary.      But as well-versed as I am in the ways of Washington, I'm the first to admit that the ways of Washington are a big part of the problem. The public is yearning for someone who is genuine and who doesn't act like a perfect politician. Unfortunately, the scandal industrial complex does its business the Washington way, judging Cain's reaction according to formulas that were written by perfect politicians.

A report, issued Friday by the Muslim Public Affairs Council, reflects the shock among American Muslims over the Fort Hood massacre, the arrests of five American Muslims in Pakistan suspected of plotting terrorist attacks, and the arrests of eight Somali-American men on charges related to what prosecutors said were efforts to recruit youths to fight for a Somali guerrilla movement.    Titled \"Building Bridges to Strengthen America: Forging an Effective Counterterrorism Enterprise between Muslim Americans and Law Enforcement,\" the paper stresses a division of labor and a collaboration between police and community groups. Police should fight crime, including terrorism, and neighborhood leaders should deal with the causes of radicalization, it says. At the same time, both need to work hand in glove, the paper said.    \"We will capture the narrative from those who seek to misguide the young people,\" said Haris Tarin, the head of the council's District of Columbia office. He was speaking Friday at a news conference in Washington that introduced the 32-page paper.    \"One incident of violent extremism is one too many,\" said Alejandro J. Beutel, the author of the report and the group's government liaison. \"Our community needs to develop more sophistication in dealing with this challenge.\"    Beutel, who also spoke at the news conference, said there needs to be a greater emphasis on community policing, an idea that calls for closer ties between neighborhood residents and cops on the beat. Developing closer relations with local Muslims would help police tap \"unique cultural and linguistic\" skills that can spot and head off trouble.    The study said police must surmount community distrust, which it says is common and calls \"an automatic barrier to police community outreach.\"    \"Unfortunately, in the current political climate, the actions of certain law enforcement agencies -- whether spying on peaceful activist groups and houses of worship without reasonable suspicion, or religious profiling -- have added to difficulties,\" the report said.    Such a \"heightened sense of fear and grievances also creates a greater pool of alienated people terrorists can tap into for recruitment,\" Beutel's report said.    Tarin and Beutel said concern about radicalism in the Muslim community isn't new: Books have been published about the subject, and imams at mosques have raised the issue for many years.    Speaking at the news conference, Tarin said that Muslim leaders need to \"think outside the box\" and engage young people in cyberspace, on social networking sites and in other social circles where they are coming together. And both men said that all Muslim groups need to work together to help confront problems like the emergence of radical thought and identify sources of discontent.    Beutel said the U.S. Muslim community can learn from the experience of the British Muslim community. While there was initial surprise that local Muslims were involved in the July 7, 2005, London bombings, Muslims there later realized that militant leaders were tapping into the problems caused by youthful alienation and social issues such as racism, drug use and premarital sex.    Beutel cites a study that says many militants had been secular before they embraced radical Islam, but they typically lacked mainstream religious knowledge. He said making communities \"religiously literate\" would help fight radicalism.    \"Muslim communities must do their part to reach out and continue to assist law enforcement to bring real terrorist perpetrators to justice,\" Beutel wrote in the report. \"The role Muslim communities should play is in counterradicalization efforts through better religious education, social programs and long-term constructive political engagement.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f31b2b103c9a2c39bc1304a65aa54ccd866eef18.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what did the sonora governor say", "id": "108586", "answers": [{"text": "\"There are destroyed families.

Maria Jesus Coronado Padilla mourns for her 2-year-old daughter, who died in the Hermosillo fire.    Parents of the dead children and their supporters have held two noisy rallies in Hermosillo, the city in northwestern Mexico where the fire broke out June 5. They blame the government for laxity in enforcing safety regulations, for conducting a weak investigation and for failing to punish anyone in the 10 days since the fatal blaze.    \"It is my fault for trusting them,\" parent Roberto Zavala said at a rally Saturday in front of the Sonora governor's office. \"I am responsible for the death of my child. Mr. Governor: Here is one of those responsible you are looking for. Come get me. I am waiting for you.\"    The rally was televised nationwide by CNN affiliate TV Azteca.    \"If there is no justice from the authorities, there will be vengeance from the people,\" Zavala shouted to great cheers.    The crowd chanted \"renuncia, renuncia\" (\"resign, resign\") toward the office of Sonora Gov. Eduardo Bours Castelo. He did not appear at the rally.    Bours told CNN on Monday that he understands parents' anguish but has not heard any calls for his resignation.    \"What we are seeing is natural,\" he said. \"There are destroyed families. It's natural that people express their sadness and, in some cases, anger. And there are those who are using this for political purposes.\"    The investigation, he said, is \"complex and advancing.\"    Mexican President Felipe Calderon has promised a full investigation.    Officials have said an air-conditioning unit in a government-run warehouse in the same building as the ABC day care center caused the fire. The privately owned day care was leased by the government to provide low-cost service to parents.    Many prominent Mexicans have joined the parents in saying the government is not doing enough to find out what happened and to punish the responsible parties.    \"There are 46 children, and nothing is happening,\" said radio and TV commentator Eduardo J. Ruiz-Healy. \"Nobody is responsible. Federal authorities say nothing major happened. There are 46 dead children, and no one will go to jail for it.\"    Ana Maria Salazar, another TV and radio commentator, also has voiced her anger -- in newspaper columns, on Facebook and on her blogs. Salazar, who lives in Mexico City, grew up in Sonora state and traveled to Hermosillo last week.    \"I just returned from Hermosillo, Sonora,\" she wrote Wednesday on her blog. \"Sorrow for the death of the [then] 44 children is now transforming into outrage. The death of these children has impacted Hermosillo, the state of Sonora and Mexico.\"    She's still angry, she told CNN on Monday.    \"My concern is that there are 46 children who died in what appears to be negligence and that nobody's going to be punished,\" Salazar said.    In addition, she said, the government has not conducted any investigations to see if other day care centers are safe.    \"What is unacceptable,\" Salazar said, \"is that nothing has been done to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"    The United Nations Children's Fund's representative in Mexico, Susana Sottoli, said all day care centers in the nation should be investigated, the state-run Notimex news agency reported Monday.    Last week, Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said officials had found safety irregularities at the ABC day care center in 2005. He declined to detail those irregularities but said authorities are investigating if anything was done about them.    ABC day care officials denied Monday ever being told of safety problems.    Critics point to cozy business relationships between the owners of the ABC day care and government officials. News reports have said one of the co-owners is a cousin of Calderon's wife. Two state government officials whose wives also are ABC co-owners resigned last week.    In all, six officials have resigned or been fired since the blaze.    The well-regarded El Universal newspaper published a column and a story Monday taking the government to task. The article says a Universal investigation revealed that family members and political allies of the governor own at least 13 day care centers in Sonora state. The ABC day care is not one of them.    Bours, who was elected governor in 2003, called the article \"malintentioned.\"    \"Some of my relatives had those [day care centers] since before I was governor,\" he said. \"This is a low blow by people who want to link one thing with another.\"    But Ruiz-Healy calls the day care industry in Mexico \"a business run by politicians and politicians' wives.\"    And he rails at what he sees as arrogance by government officials, whose actions, he said, have led to \"a total crisis of credibility.\"    \"There have been a series of events that insult our intelligence,\" Ruiz-Healy said. \"The political class is divorced from reality and from the rest of the country.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/3971f1b87ff0d6962934cd2d14a8a896400a2cd5.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "who was a medical student", "id": "108588", "answers": [{"text": "Philip Markoff,", "answer_start": 677}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- They were crimes born of the Internet age -- romantic solicitations on popular Web site Craigslist that police say led to the fatal shooting of one woman and the robbery of another in Boston hotels this past spring.    Internet forensic expert Mark Rasch used high-tech sleuthing to help police in Boston's Craigslist crimes.    And it was high-tech, 21st-century sleuthing, along with some old-fashioned gumshoe detective work, that put police on the trail toward a suspect and eventually an arrest.    On CNN's \"AC 360\"  Randi Kaye recently took a behind-the-scenes look at how technology was used to lead police to 23-year-old medical student Philip Markoff, who has been indicted on seven counts, including first-degree murder.    Prosecutors said Julissa Brisman, a model from New York who advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, was shot three times at close range and suffered blunt head trauma at the Marriott Copley Place hotel on April 14. And a 29-year-old Las Vegas, Nevada, woman was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards at the Westin Copley Place hotel, police reports said. Read the AC360 blog post    Investigators knew they had crimes born of the Internet on their hands, but how were they able to use that same technology to help them find a suspect who went to great lengths to hide his tracks?    \"The figures involved communicated with each other [via] text and e-mail, and they only met at the very last minute,\" said special correspondent Maureen Orth, who investigated the story for Vanity Fair magazine. \"And then the way the police were able to solve the crime was going back, using the clicks and the Internet addresses.\"    In Brisman's case, police knew she had communicated on Craigslist with a person calling himself \"Andy.\"    Mark Rasch once headed the computer crimes unit at the U.S. Department of Justice. Now an Internet forensic expert, he helped Boston police track the alleged killer.    \"The first thing you start with was the e-mail address. In this case, it's an e-mail address from Live.com, which is Microsoft,\" Rasch explained to CNN's Kaye.  Watch Randi Kaye's full report \u00bb    Rasch showed Kaye the tracer program he used to help follow the e-mails from \"Andy.\"    \"Trace Back does what it says -- traces the route that the e-mail took on its way from its origin to the destination,\" Rasch said.    Rasch says police got the Internet protocol address for the e-mailer's computer. From there, investigators tracked down the company providing Internet service to the suspect, which told them that the subscriber lived in a Quincy apartment building, outside Boston.    Even though police had what they believed was the killer's real name and home address, that still was not enough, Kaye reports.    \"They have to validate and actually get this guy's fingers on the keyboard,\" Rasch said. \"So in the end, they reverted to the old gumshoe thing of a stakeout.\"    Police zeroed in on Markoff. They'd seen a tall, blond male they believed was the killer on the hotel surveillance cameras. And they did what many people do on a daily basis -- they Googled him.    Police learned their prime suspect was a medical student at Boston University. He was engaged to be married.    Again, the Internet helped. They got a better look at him through pictures with his fiancee online. It's a piece of a digital trail criminals rarely think about, Kaye reported.    \"As one of the law enforcement people told me, if you can see it, they can see it,\" Orth said.    Markoff's cyber footprint was growing more clear to authorities every day. On April 20, six days after Brisman's slaying, detectives arrested him.    They said he was carrying on him a New York driver's license with a photo of someone named Andrew or Andy Miller. Police say Markoff used that driver's license to purchase the gun that killed Brisman and that his fingerprints were on the paperwork.    In June, Markoff pleaded not guilty to Brisman's death and the other charges against him. He remains in jail.

Sen. John McCain recommended expanding the Afghan army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops.  The Arizona senator, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that while he approved of President Obama's recent decision to send 17,000 more troops to the country, he believed an additional allied military and civilian surge would be necessary to prevent it from once again becoming an al Qaeda safe haven.  The Obama administration is conducting a review of overall U.S. policy in the troubled Islamic republic, the president said in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday.  \"With our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat extremism,\" Obama said Tuesday. \"Because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world. We will not allow it.\"  But McCain said on Wednesday, \"When you aren't winning in this kind of war, you are losing. And, in Afghanistan today, we are not winning.\" He delivered his remarks at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank.  McCain claimed that while the situation in Afghanistan is \"nowhere near as dire as it was in Iraq,\" the number of insurgent attacks had spiked in 2008 and violence had increased more than 500 percent in the past four years.  Growing portions of the country \"suffer under the influence of the Taliban,\" he added.  McCain's comments echoed those of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who acknowledged last Friday that the United States is facing a \"very tough test\" in Afghanistan.  \"But I'm sure we will rise to the occasion the way we have many times before,\" Gates told a news conference in Krakow, Poland, where NATO defense ministers were meeting.  McCain said that the U.S. was winning the war in Afghanistan through early 2005, when some troops were withdrawn and \"our integrated civil-military command structure was disassembled and replaced by a Balkanized and dysfunctional arrangement.\"  A Vietnam War veteran, former prisoner of war and longtime member of the Armed Services Committee, McCain said that while he knows Americans \"are weary of war ... we must win [in Afghanistan]. The alternative is to risk that country's return to its previous function as a terrorist sanctuary, from which al Qaeda could train and plan attacks against America.\"  Among other things, McCain stated that the U.S. needs to establish a larger military headquarters capable of executing \"the necessary planning and coordination for a nationwide counterinsurgency campaign.\"  He also said plans to expand the Afghan army from 68,000 to 134,000 troops were insufficient. He recommended expanding the Afghan army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops.  At the same time, he said, the U.S. needs to boost the country's nonmilitary assistance to help strengthen \"its [civilian] institutions, the rule of law, and the economy in order to provide a sustainable alternative to the drug trade.\"  Southern Afghanistan provides about two thirds of the world's opium and heroin. Over the years, those two drugs have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency, including the Taliban.  McCain warned that, even if his recommendations are adopted, the violence in Afghanistan is \"likely to get worse before it gets better. The scale of resources required to prevail will be enormous.\"  The timetable, he concluded, \"will be measured in years, not months.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/12a6befbe4842bd94aa91c1b4446d7a695ae9d0f.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When did she disappear?", "id": "108592", "answers": [{"text": "went missing March 27", "answer_start": 263}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Thousands of mourners filled a Tracy, California, high school gym Thursday to remember slain 8-year-old Sandra Renee Cantu.  Sandra Cantu, 8, had been missing almost two weeks before her body was found.  The little girl made national headlines after she went missing March 27 from a mobile home park in Tracy where she lived with her family.  She was on her way to a friend's home and her playful skipping down an alley was caught by a surveillance camera. Police later found her body stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a nearby dairy farm.  Photos of Sandra, flowers and stuffed animals covered the front of the stage. Family members, friends and state dignitaries memorialized the child during a ceremony that lasted just over an hour.  The printed program called the memorial service \"A Celebration of Life,\" and organizers said they hoped the service would help ease the pain the community has suffered since Sandra's disappearance.  \"We are left with the haunting image of her skipping on the streets of Tracy. But today she is skipping on the streets of gold, into the arms of a loving God\", said Brent Ives, mayor of Tracy.  Cindy Sasser, principal at Jacobsen Elementary School told mourners, \"We should all strive to be like Sandra -- always smiling, wanting to help, to look out for others and to be caring.\"  The service included a video that showcased some of the family's favorite photos.  People from across California attended, filling the gymnasium, cafeteria and the football stadium at West High School.  Melissa Huckaby, 28, a Sunday school teacher who lived in the same mobile home park as Sandra's family, has been charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14, and rape by instrument.  If convicted, she would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett said this week.

The year was 1930. About a week earlier, the 10-year-old girl from what is now called St. Petersburg, Russia, had embarked on a transatlantic journey with her Ukrainian parents from the French port city of Cherbourg, escaping what she described as Jewish persecution at the start of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union.      On an island near Manhattan stood the copper colossus that would etch her first memories of the new world.      \"It was a wonderful sight,\" she said of the Statue of Liberty, which marked its 125th anniversary Friday.      The idea for the monument is thought to have been conceived at a 19th-century dinner party among French aristocrats, historians say, who sought to pay tribute to American liberty.      And while the French gift is also widely believed to have at least in part catered to domestic politics, for many, it quickly became a symbol of hope and promise in America's post- Civil War period.      \"The arrival on Ellis Island is the fulfillment that you know something good is going to happen to you,\" said Belarksy, now a 91-year-old widow living in a Russian enclave of Brooklyn, New York.      Her family became part of the more than 12 million immigrants processed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954, according to the U.S. National Park Service.      Adjacent to Ellis towers Lady Liberty, measuring more than 305 feet from base to torch.      Originally, the statue was supposed to be an Egyptian peasant girl that would have stood at the entrance of Egypt's then-new Suez Canal, but plans would evolve into the Roman goddess who would instead adorn New York Harbor.      \"The sculptor, (Frederic) Bartholdi, was very clever,\" said Edward Berenson, professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at New York University.      \"He put (the statue) where he did because it's right at the narrows of New York Harbor, so he knew that every boat that came into New York would have to come really close to it.      People felt like they could reach out and touch it,\" he said.      Inspired perhaps by Egypt's colossal statues during his own travels to Cairo, Berenson noted, Bartholdi sought to build a monument of his own in a tribute to American liberty and its newfound emancipation of the slaves.      The statue rests atop a sculpted wrangling of broken chains on New York's Liberty Island.      Only years later, Berenson argues, did the monument come to symbolize immigration to the broader public, despite the structure's engraved plaque bearing the now-famous poem by Emma Lazarus, asking for the \"huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"      Like many who made the perilous journey, Belarsky said, she had often wondered what kind of life was waiting for her on the shores behind the monument.      \"It was quite frightening,\" she recalled. \"The three of us, my father, my mother and I, wanted for someone to come with money or to tell us what's next.\"      And though a U.S. law passed six years earlier had largely restricted immigration, her father, Sidor, had managed to secure three tickets to America by way of a talent scout who visited the Leningrad conservatory where he had performed as an opera singer.      \"He had such a beautiful voice,\" she said.      Their travel permit, however, was only temporary.      Sidor had acquired a six-month visa to teach at Brigham Young University, Belarsky said.      The young family would nonetheless settle more permanently in a west Manhattan apartment. And unlike many who eventually returned to their homelands in Europe, the Belarskys decided to leave St. Petersburg -- then known as Leningrad -- behind.      \"Authorities were starting to clamp down and consolidate the social state and Soviet power around Stalin,\" said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \"As an opera singer, you might not have wanted to start singing Soviet anthems.\"      So the young family left Russia without plans to return, Belarsky added.      And though many immigrants entered the United States through Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New Orleans and Miami, historians say steamship companies most often cruised into New York Harbor, commonly making the Statue of Liberty the first land sighting for new arrivals.      \"Everybody spoke of the golden land,\" Belarksy said.      \" 'Come to America, where there's gold on the streets,' until they came here and they had to live in walk-up tenement houses,\" she said, referencing hardships often endured in overcrowded city buildings.      Immigrants also commonly faced unsanitary and unsafe work conditions on docks and in factories as America's need for industrial labor grew.      \"If you think immigration is unpopular now,\" Berenson said, \"if anything, it was even more unpopular in the 1890s and the first part of the 20th century.\"      Successive immigrant waves, however, still rushed to America's shores through Ellis Island and past the Statue of Liberty, often buoyed by the prospect of economic opportunity.      \"I think it took a while for people to think of themselves as Americans,\" Berenson said. \"For an awful lot of people, what they wanted was to think of themselves as whatever they were originally and as Americans too.\"      Anniversary celebrations of the Statue of Liberty were marked Friday by a series of official speeches and an array of webcams, provided by Earthcam, that streamed video footage from the torch.      The statue will close for renovations starting Saturday, though Liberty Island will remain open, according to the National Park Service."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/2fc4ead5acc3e68793bf767e706ca46e60fc81b8.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How much film cost?", "id": "108603", "answers": [{"text": "a little over $11,000 (\u00a37,000) to make,", "answer_start": 4269}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A schoolteacher from southern England with no previous filmmaking experience has given amateurism a good name by directing her pupils in a feature film fit for Hollywood.    Alice Ralph, 18, stars in \"Far From the Madding Crowd\" as Bathsheba Everdene.    It has taken a year of hard work using only one camera, but teachers and pupils at The Gryphon School in Sherborne, Dorset, recently premiered their 110-minute long adaptation of English novelist Thomas Hardy's seminal 1874 work \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\"    \"When I watched it for the first time, it was actually quite an emotional experience,\" director/producer and Head of Drama Rosita Clarke told CNN.    \"It's a kind of relief to see the efforts of what you've worked on and achieved an absolute reality.\"    Clarke is the driving force behind the project and says many people didn't believe she would be able to pull off a feature film when she first came up with the idea.    \"Miss Clarke pitched the idea, and said she was going to make a feature film and we all thought she was joking,\" said 18-year-old Ben Jones, a Gryphon student, who plays Sergeant Troy in the film. \"But we all kind of went along with it and it's turned into this.\"    Clarke was inspired to make the feature after she directed a play with some film footage in it the previous year. \"I thought to myself, 'I'm going to make a film,'\" she said.    After getting permission from the school, Clarke sat down with Hardy's book during the school summer holidays and over two weeks wrote a screenplay. In August 2008, Gryphon's Hardy feature went into production.    \"Far From the Madding Crowd\" unfolds against the backdrop of rural 19th Century England and tells the story of beautiful Bathsheba Everdene who inherits a farm from her uncle and finds herself loved by three men.    The feature was filmed over weekends, holidays and snatched evenings after school. It is full of exquisite costumes, gorgeous Dorset vistas and faultless acting from students aged between 16 and 18-years old.    Despite the demands of the shooting schedule, the students say they were able to fit in their schoolwork around it. \"As far as the study goes, it's been ok,\" said Jones. Watch CNN The Screening Room's Myleene Klass report on the Gryphon School's London premiere    The pupils involved say it didn't undermine their studies, and in some cases helped it by giving them an invaluable experience in an industry they would like to work in in the future.    \"Some of us want to get into the profession and this experience has been really valuable,\" said Jack Buckley, 18, who plays shepherd Gabriel Oak. \"We haven't done any film acting before and it's very different to stage acting so we've learn a lot about that.\"    But the experience has not been without challenges: Using just one camera Clarke and her team had to film a fire in a 19th Century hayrick [haystack], work with livestock including sheep and shoot large crowd scenes.    In total 130 pupils worked on the film in roles from hair and make-up to walk-on parts.    Alice Ralph, 18, who stars as Bathsheba, says acting for the camera was one aspect that took some getting used to.    \"At first I found it really hard to get used to the camera. I found it really awkward,\" she said. \"I remember the first shoot. I couldn't even say my lines.\"    Emotional scenes shot up-close requiring convincing tears and restrained acting also proved a challenge for the students who are used to acting on stage.    \"The emotional scenes were actually really difficult,\" said Ralph. \"I found them quite hard to get, with the crying and things but with Mrs Clarke's help she put me in a situation and I'd use emotional memory and I'd get there in the end.\"    Clarke had no experience of filmmaking when she started up and used the Internet and books to learn about lighting and camera angles. She also picked up some tips on camera work from her 21-year-old son, Sunny, a broadcast production student.    Sunny also edited the film and Clarke says he had the editor's final word and helped her to keep the film slick.    \"I wanted as many students as possible to have a little showing, and he's looking at it from a professional level of final finish.\"    The film cost a little over $11,000 (\u00a37,000) to make, much of which Clarke raised from banks and supermarkets in the local community.    \"We haven't had money and we couldn't get the sound right all the time and it got dark too quickly because we were trying to get it all done and it's just been so pressurized,\" says Clarke.    Nevertheless, she was always convinced she would successfully complete the film --  \"It wasn't ever not going to happen.\"    For Clarke the best bit of the film is \"the success for the students.

Gregory Smith ordered the change as part of the new military strategy in the war that focuses on protecting Afghan citizens rather than killing militants.    \"Indicating the number of insurgents killed has little relevance to impacting the lives of Afghans. In fact, if that were the only purpose and metric, you would likely only extend the time it takes to bring about an end to the insurgency,\" Smith said in an e-mail to CNN responding to a query about the change.    The issue of publishing enemy body counts has been extremely sensitive to the U.S. military since the Vietnam War when the military regularly published large enemy body counts but seemed to be failing overall to make progress in the war.    In the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon has shifted policies several times, both publishing numbers in news releases on particular engagements and firefights and also declaring it would not publish body counts.    In the past some military officials have said the numbers have been part of individual releases to the media as a means of demonstrating success against enemy forces.    Smith said, \"We conduct operations not aimed at killing insurgents, although in many instances that is the outcome, but to over time clear areas of insurgency and give the people a chance to reconnect with official forms of governance and to rebuild their lives, socially and economically.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/5b52dd51f097dd9b8440348349ed6688a5b999cb.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where has  killing of three happen?", "id": "108612", "answers": [{"text": "Fullerton, California,", "answer_start": 558}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The man police say was driving drunk when he ran a red light and struck a car, killing a Major League Baseball pitcher and two others has been charged with murder.  Fans gather around a memorial for Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart on Friday.  Andrew Thomas Gallo, 22, was charged with three counts of murder, driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a crime, the Orange County district attorney's office announced Friday.  Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was among those killed in the crash in Fullerton, California, early Thursday morning. Adenhart was beginning his first full season in the majors and had pitched his fourth Major League game hours earlier.  Gallo, whose blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit, according to police, faces up to life in prison if convicted on all charges.  According to the DA's office, Gallo was driving a minivan 65 mph in a 35 mph zone at about 12:35 a.m. Thursday. He was on probation and his license had been suspended after a previous drunk-driving charge.

He was captured about 30 minutes later.  Adenhart pitched in a game against the Oakland A's Wednesday night in Anaheim, California, making what was characterized as a \"brilliant effort\" despite the Angels' 6-4 loss, according to Major League Baseball's Web site, MLB.com.  In his fourth major league start, Adenhart pitched a scoreless six innings, allowing seven hits, three walks and five strikeouts.  \"The Angels family has suffered a tremendous loss today,\" Tony Reagins, the team's general manager, said in a written statement. \"We are deeply saddened and shocked by this tragic loss.

The Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation's 720-page report said that it has \"no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up\" from January 1975 to May 2004, the time covered by the report.    \"The Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets,\" the report said.    \"The welfare of children, which should have been the first priority, was not even a factor to be considered in the early stages,\" it said.    \"Instead the focus was on the avoidance of scandal and the preservation of the good name, status and assets of the institution and of what the institution regarded as its most important members -- the priests.\"    Archbishop Diarmuid Martin apologized Thursday in a news conference. \"No words of apology can ever be sufficient,\" he said.    And Dermot Ahern, Ireland's justice minister, said he felt a \"a growing sense of revulsion and anger\" as he read the report.    \"Bottom line is this: A collar will protect no villain,\" he said.    The commission was set up in March 2006 to look into allegations of child sexual abuse made against clergy in the Irish capital. Its report was completed in July.    Although the commission said it was not its place to \"establish whether or not abuse occurred ... it is abundantly clear ... that child sexual abuse by clerics was widespread throughout the period.\"    One victim, Marie Collins, said those who covered up the abuse were just as guilty as the perpetrators of the crimes.    \"How many people accused of abuse are still sitting in parishes today?\" she asked in a Thursday news conference.    The commission examined the histories of 46 priests, who were picked as a sample from 102 who had had complaints or suspicions of child abuse raised against them. Complaints from more than 320 children were leveled against the 46, the report said.    But it said that the number of children abused likely exceeded that.    \"One priest admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children, while another accepted that he had abused on a fortnightly basis during the currency of his ministry which lasted for over 25 years,\" the report said.    \"The total number of documented complaints recorded against those two priests is only just over 70.\"    In its analysis of the 46 priests, the commission said that all four archbishops -- Archbishops John Charles McQuaid, Dermot Ryan, Kevin McNamara, and Desmond Connell -- who served during the time period covered by the report handled the child sexual abuse complaints \"badly.\"    \"Not one of them reported his knowledge of child sexual abuse to the Gardai (the Irish police force) throughout the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s,\" the report said.    The commission did credit Connell, who took over the archdiocese in 1988, with giving Irish authorities in 1995 the names of 17 priests against whom complaints had been made -- although it called the number incomplete, saying that there was \"knowledge within the Archdiocese of at least 28 priests against whom there had been complaints.\"    They said he was \"slow to recognize the seriousness of the situation.\"    Connell also gave authorities permission to access the archdiocesan files in 2002.    Connell, a cardinal, apologized in a written statement. \"I wish to express without reservation my bitter regret that failures on my part contributed to the suffering of victims in any form,\" he said.    \"Although I am all too aware that such apologies and expressions of regret can never be adequate as a response to so much hurt and violation and, in any case, lose their value through repetition, I apologize again now from my heart and ask the forgiveness of those who have been so shamefully harmed.\"    The report named 11 priests who had pleaded guilty to or were convicted of sexual assaults on children. Of the other 35, it gave pseudonyms to 33 of them and redacted the names of two.    The report shot down the notion that church leadership was unaware of the problem. \"The Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities have repeatedly claimed to have been, prior to the late 1990s, 'on a learning curve' in relation to the matter,\" it said.    However, it said McNamara, Ryan and McQuaid had information on complaints against at least 17 priests when the Archdiocese took out insurance in 1987 to cover future compensation claims and lawsuits related to sexual abuse allegations.    \"The taking out of insurance was an act proving knowledge of child sexual abuse as a potential major cost to the Archdiocese and is inconsistent with the view that Archdiocesan officials were still 'on a learning curve' at a much later date, or were lacking in an appreciation of the phenomenon of clerical child sex abuse,\" it said.    The report also said church officials perpetuated the problem by ignoring allegations and in some cases simply moved an alleged abuser on to another parish -- leaving him free to abuse another group of children.    Thursday's findings follow a report that came out in May, detailing allegations of child abuse in various institutions across Ireland from the 1940s to the present. Though both reports deal with child abuse, they are not related, having been written by two separate commissions investigating two different subjects.    The May report looked at child abuse in lay institutions, including reformatories, hospitals, orphanages, children's homes and industrial schools across the country. Some of those institutions were linked to religious orders, but none were strictly religious schools.    Speaking last month after the Irish High Court cleared the way for Thursday's report to be made public, Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern said he was pleased the information would not be kept private.    \"I have always made it clear that I have been anxious to put the report into the public domain as quickly as possible, while at the same time not wishing to do anything which would prejudice the chances of any of the people involved in these evil deeds being brought to justice,\" Ahern said in a statement.

Jamison Green transitioned from female to male just before his 40th birthday.    Welcome, Chaz!    Before the word \"transsexual\" had been coined in English, an intrepid young person whose family belonged to the British nobility set out to transform herself from female to male. He received a medical school education, obtained hormones -- relatively new substances that were poorly understood at the time, and independently began living as a man in the early 1940s.    Eventually, he found a plastic surgeon to help him, and his physical changes were complete by 1949, but his family rejected him. The British tabloids hounded him. To escape publicity, he was forced to carve out a life for himself virtually alone. He became a Buddhist monk, and died in Tibet in 1962 at the age of 47.    His name was Michael Dillon, and he one of the Western world's first transsexual people, that is, someone who changes sex and/or gender by medical means. His extensive writings were suppressed and destroyed by his family -- only fragments survive.    By 1988, when I began my transition (just before my 40th birthday), there was scarcely more information about female-to-male transsexualism available than there was in 1949. Even in the early 1990s, doctors told transsexual people that we should not socialize together, because people might notice there were things about us that were different from \"normal\" people.    Many transsexual women were tall and some had broad shoulders, large hands and feet. Most transsexual men were on the short side, and had small hands and feet. It's one thing if you mix in with other people where there is a lot of physical diversity, but if you congregate with others like you, you may risk discovery.    To be discovered as a transsexual person was a horrible fate. And fitting in, being \"normal,\" was the goal of treatment, after all. I was convinced that having a \"sex change\" was going to be a very straightforward process. I would take the hormones, have some surgery, and then go home and mow my lawn. I expected life to just be ordinary, just the way it was supposed to be.    There were a few surprises in store for me, though, not the least of which was that I learned that the fear and shame of being known or discovered to be a transsexual person was probably responsible for a tremendous amount of suffering.    I learned that people like me hid themselves from the world, often were under-employed or unemployed, avoided seeing physicians when they were ill, and often expected that they would never have intimate partners.    After I began transition, I met more and more transsexual men like myself, and I saw firsthand the fear and shame that limited their lives. These were kind, gentle, thoughtful, serious men, and they did not deserve to live in a state of fear and shame.    I knew then that education about who we were, and what our lives were like, would be absolutely necessary to do two things: first to let people like me know we were not alone and we didn't have to be afraid; and second to let other people know we existed, to make the world safe for us, for our difference and our uniqueness.    Like a handful of other trans men in North America, Europe, England, and Japan, I began to do public education, to write about our experience, and to educate legislators and policy makers, helping them change the laws, hoping to ease the suffering of others like ourselves who would follow in our footsteps.    And now Chaz Bono announces his transition through his publicist. O, brave new world! The words are here, some protective laws have been passed, America has learned that it can no longer simply destroy what it doesn't understand. Not that some people won't try, though.    Chaz, here's hoping your transition from female to male will be effortless, but experience tells me you're liable to have (at least) a few surprises and inconveniences along the way. Here's hoping you can maintain the privacy you want, and that you have the ability to experience your transition fully, that you aren't robbed of the experience by the demands of a public life.    Your visibility can bring new understanding. Where others of us have run from the spotlight, and still others have been denied a voice by a disinterested public, you have the ear of the media, and you will not be ignored. But don't be tempted to expose yourself when you're not ready. Your life must be your own.    For me, the goal of transition was not to become \"normal\" -- whatever that is -- but to become balanced as myself. It's a life goal that non-trans people strive for, too, and we all have different paths to get there. My path worked for me; I hope yours works for you. Good luck, brother!

Bhutto sits on stage at a campaign rally minutes before her assassination.    \"For standing up outside the car, I think it was she to blame alone -- nobody else. Responsibility is hers,\" the former general told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday.    Bhutto was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi, south of the Pakistani capital Islamabad, while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for now-postponed parliamentary elections. Her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack.    The cause of her death is not clear: a bomber blew himself up near Bhutto's limousine and videotape showed a gunman present, though no autopsy has been carried out.    Asked if Bhutto could have been shot, Musharraf said, \"Yes, absolutely, yes. Possibility.\" He has said he welcomes an international investigation.    Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to Bhutto, who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister. He noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and \"was given more security than any other person.\"    Asked about the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, widely rumored to be in the remote border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Musharraf said, \"There is no proof whatsoever that he's here. We are not particularly looking for him, but we are operating against this -- and al Qaeda and militant Taliban. And in the process, obviously, it is combined. Maybe we are looking for him also.\"    And Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Mahmud Ali Durrani, told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" that, \"If we knew where he was, we would have taken him out.\"    Durrani added that Musharraf's comment about \"not specifically looking for Osama\" means that the Pakistani military is \"totally focused on destroying al Qaeda and the Taliban network and not just one person.\"    About Bhutto's death, he noted only that the investigation is not completed \"and we should not jump to conclusions.\"    Still, he added, \"if she had not come out of the vehicle, the protected and armored vehicle, maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today.\"    Though Musharraf's popularity at home has plummeted, he retains support from GOP presidential contender Sen. John McCain.    \"I think he's a good man,\" the Arizonan told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"But I think he's made mistakes, don't get me wrong. And we've got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair.    \"But I can work with him. He understands the threat to his country that the Taliban and al Qaeda present. And radical Islamic extremists. He's a very smart man. He'd be one of the first to go. They've tried to kill him nine times, OK? Nine times they've tried to kill Musharraf. He's not their favorite guy.\"    The New York Times reported Sunday that the Bush administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of Pakistan to shore up support for Musharraf's government and to find bin Laden and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson of New Mexico told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" that, though he had not heard details of the plan, \"it sounds like a strategy that makes sense.\"    He added, \"We have got to take whatever action is needed.\"    Richardson has called for Musharraf to step down and has called for free and fair elections.    \"What we need to do is ask Musharraf, push him, push him to step aside for the good of the country, because he is widely unpopular,\" he told CNN.    Sen. Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said Saturday that she would try to persuade Musharraf to share the responsibility for safeguarding his country's nuclear weapons with a delegation from the United States and perhaps Great Britain.    Meanwhile, detectives from Britain's Scotland Yard on Sunday once again examined the white Land Cruiser that Bhutto was riding in when she was assassinated, Pakistan's state-run news agency said.    The Associated Press of Pakistan said the detectives also watched videos of Bhutto's last moments three times, and looked at bird's eye view photographs of Liaqat Bagh park taken from a building that overlooks the Rawalpindi public site.    The team of five detectives arrived in Pakistan Friday after Musharraf agreed they should work alongside Pakistani agencies to determine how Bhutto was killed and who was responsible for her death.    On Saturday, the team spent more than two hours at the park.    Musharraf said he expected the Scotland Yard investigators to help \"solve all the confusion\" surrounding the case. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, wants a United Nations inquiry into his late wife's assassination.    The Pakistan interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car's sunroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy.    However, supporters of Bhutto insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast.

If you're at Starbucks and in need of just a little caffeine, don't worry -- there's a tiny option for you. It's the Short size, and they don't advertise it. It's like a little baby cup of coffee. It also comes in handy when you're scrounging for change and don't have enough for a tall (not that that has ever happened to me).    2. It's a good thing we don't have Jamba Juice here in Iowa, because I would be all over candy-based smoothies. Because it's considered a health-food chain, Jamba Juice doesn't officially list these on their in-store menus, but the Web site Mighty Foods assures us that the secret flavors exist.    The ones they confirmed with the company's headquarters include Strawberry Shortcake, White Gummy Bear, PB&J, Various flavors of Starbursts, Fruity Pebbles, Push-Up Pops, and Skittles. Other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist: Chocolate Gummi Bear, Apple Pie, Sourpatch Kid, Tootsie Roll, and Now and Later.    3. This one might be my favorite. At Fatburger, you can order a Hypocrite -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon.    4. Chipotle has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available, they will make it for you. Things that have been tested include nachos, quesadillas, taco salads and single tacos. Some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item, however, so maybe someday soon you won't need a super-secret handshake to order one.

If you're at Wendy's and you're really hungry -- like, three-patties-just-won't-cut-it hungry -- go ahead and order the Grand Slam, which is four patties stacked on a bun. This option is only available at select Wendy's, and it's also known as the Meat Cube.    6. Several places, including McDonald's and In-N-Out, will serve you the Neapolitan milkshake. It's just what it sounds like -- chocolate, vanilla and strawberry shakes layered in a cup.    7. In-N-Out Burger's \"secret menu\" isn't so secret these days -- in fact, they've posted it on their Web site. But in case you're not in the habit of surfing fast food Web sites, here's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items: ordering something \"Animal Style\" at In-N-Out means you're going to get it with lettuce, tomato, a mustard-cooked beef patty, pickles, extra spread (it's sort of Thousand-Islandy) and grilled onions. You can even get your fries Animal Style.    Mental Floss: Why is it called \"Thousand Island\" dressing?    \"Protein Style\" is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun. A Grilled Cheese is two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato and spread on a bun (grilled onions if you so choose).    And you can get just about any combo of meat and cheese that you want if you order it like you're ordering lumber: 3\u00d73 gets you three beef patties and three slices of cheese, 4\u00d74 gets you four of each, and so on. According to photos posted at SuperSizedMeals.com, one gluttonous patron requested and received a 100x100 at a Las Vegas store a few years ago. One item not listed on the Web site secret menu: the Flying Dutchman, which is two slices of cheese sandwiched between two patties, hold the bun.    8. Feeling a little health-conscious at Popeye's? If you are, you really should have gone somewhere else. But there's a little hope for you -- ordering \"naked chicken\" will get you breading-free poultry. The word is that this is on the menu at some Popeye's, but not all of them, although it is an option at all of them.    9. Like Chipotle, Taco Bell will make you just about anything within reason as long as they have the ingredients for it. Since most of the food at Taco Bell is made out of the same basic items, that means you can probably ask for most discontinued items and get them. One \"secret,\" though, is that they have a not-advertised green chili sauce at most locations, and apparently it's excellent.    10. Some Subways will still make you the popular pizza sub from the 1990s. Once the chain decided to make their focus healthy eating, the pizza sub disappeared from the menu in most places (the word is that Canadian and Mexican Subways still offer them on a regular basis). But if you ask, lots of places will still make it for you. Be warned, though -- Jared would not approve of the nine slices of pepperoni and copious amounts of cheese slathered in marinara sauce.

After getting our hands on one yesterday, we found that it's a solid, well-performing slate that's easy on the eyes. Too bad it has such a stupid name.      The 4G Xyboard is Motorola's follow-up to its pricey, not terribly popular Xoom tablet, which was released in February. Available in 8.2-inch and 10.1-inch versions, the Honeycomb-powered Xyboard enters the market hot on the heels of the super-hot Kindle Fire.

The first thing that struck me about the Xyboard is its industrial design. Rather than being perfectly rectangular in shape, the 8.2-inch slate has clipped corners, which actually makes it fit more comfortably when you hold it one-handed.      The back, too, shows some stylistic creativity. A rubberized outer rim houses a power button and volume rocker, while centered in the back of the tablet is a sheet of dark gray brushed metal held in place by six visible screws.

The 8.2-inch size, however, is a great compromise between the 7-inch 'tweeners and 10-inch stunners.      It's small enough to wield in one hand with ease (the 0.86-pound weight helps with that too), yet large enough that watching a full-screen, HD YouTube video or a movie on Netflix is pleasant. Pair that with Verizon's 4G speeds, and you've got great streaming video quality.      The overall experience is smooth, an improvement over many of the past buggy iterations of Honeycomb (perhaps the longer lead time gave Google the room to stabilize). Powered by a dual-core 1.2GHz processor with 1GB of RAM, app loading times are reasonably swift, and swiping from one screen to another on its Honeycomb interface is stutter-free.      Unlike HTC and Samsung devices, it's not overly skinned, so you can actually experience the Android OS for what it is, rather than a bogged down, bloated mess. The Xyboard will be eligible for an Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade at some point in the future, but for now, it runs Honeycomb very well.      Both the 8.2- and 10.1-inch models have a 1280 x 800 resolution display. After turning up the brightness from auto to full, the tablet's battery life dropped from around 20 percent to around 5 percent in less than an hour, so it looks like you'll need to be conscious of your 4G and brightness settings if you don't want your tablet to die on you quickly.      If you're one of those people who likes to take pictures with their tablet (read: you are a dork), the Xyboard has a 5-megapixel back-facing camera and a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera on its face. The rear camera's quality is relatively sub-par compared to what you'd get from other comparable cameras, and definitely shoddier compared to the 8-megapixel standard of most 2011 handsets.      The colors are bright and close to true to life, but the overall image lacks sharpness. The camera does have some variable settings though, for white balance, color effects, and scene mode. Video quality was also just 'meh': a video taken indoors at the Wired offices was noticeably grainy.      Overall, the Xyboard seems like a decent tablet. The slate looks slick and feels good in your hands, and is powerful enough to provide a successful tablet experience. It's a bit of a shame that it's shipping with Honeycomb instead of ICS, but that's certainly not a deal breaker.      What's a real shame, though, is that it's available now, and not six months ago.

Umar Ahmed and his wife wait for anti-HIV drugs at a hospital in Nigeria.    Under the dusty sun, the fathers of the bride and groom agreed to the marriage and this ancient Muslim tradition proceeded as it has for hundreds of years.    But unknown to the gathered villagers, the couple is hiding a modern secret.    Both bride and groom are HIV-positive and marrying with the support of a local government program that encourages such \"HIV-marriages\" in the hope of preventing the virus from spreading.    After the ceremony and away from the village, the husband agreed to speak with CNN as long as he was not identified.    \"The woman I marry loves me -- I love her,\" he said. \"And we promised that we can keep ourselves healthy and clean.\"    According to the United Nations, Nigeria has the third-largest HIV population in the world, with about 3.1 percent of its 148 million people infected.    Officials working for the Bauchi State Agency for the Control of AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, known as BACATMA, hope to put a dent in those numbers -- not just by treating HIV-positive people with free antiretroviral drugs but, they say, by helping more than 100 HIV-positive couples marry.    The agency offers to pay for the dowry, provide counseling and even employment within the agency. BACATMA officials hope that, by keeping HIV-positive couples together, they will keep AIDS from spreading to anyone not infected.    \"If someone having HIV marries another HIV-AIDS person, that means there will be no HIV transmission to another negative person,\" said Rilwanu Mohammed, the BACATMA chairman.    However, UNAIDS, the UN agency tackling HIV and AIDS, has its doubts, arguing such marriages do not prevent the spread of AIDS.    \"There are better methods to address the prevention of HIV and AIDS rather than encouraging that kind of union,\" said Warren Naamara, the UNAIDS Nigeria coordinator.    \"We have made it very clear from UNAIDS that the best way to address HIV infection is universal access to prevention, treatment and care.\"    There is no evidence that such marriages stop the spread of AIDS. However, for many of the couples, the marriages support their personal fight against AIDS and the stigmatization it often brings from society, friends and family.    That stigmatization can lead HIV-positive people to become outcasts, discriminated against and sometimes physically abused.    Queuing for their antiretroviral drugs at a local hospital, Umar Ahmed and his wife said they married last year and have since had a child.    \"Before, I was lonely,\" Umar said. \"Being with my wife, I feel great -- because we stay together, we discuss different issues together.\"    For those couples who decide to have children, BACATMA tries to reduce the odds that the child will be born infected with HIV by ensuring that the parents have antiretroviral agents and medical advice.    Still, the decision to have a child is a controversial one when the parents who decide to do so are sick and unlikely to be able to raise the child."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/22ab285169b05273e3ec7212284441768abdc7cb.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What kind of ale is in the song BINGO?", "id": "108638", "answers": [{"text": "Styngo!", "answer_start": 2065}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(Mental Floss) -- Either I had a really short attention span as a kid and never made it past the first verse of a song -- which is entirely possible -- or there are some obscure lyrics to the songs we all know and love.      1. \"The Teapot Song\" goes on to further explain this little teapot character:      I'm a clever teapot, Yes it's true Here let me show you What I can do I can change my handle And my spout Just tip me over and pour me out!      2. \"Do Your Ears Hang Low?\" I'm impressed that a children's song contains the word \"semaphore.\"      Do your ears hang high?

There are a few variations. One of them goes like this:      In a cavern, in a canyon, Excavating for a mine Dwelt a miner forty niner, And his daughter Clementine Light she was and like a fairy, And her shoes were number nine, Wearing boxes, without topses, Sandals were for Clementine. Drove she ducklings to the water Ev'ry morning just at nine, Hit her foot against a splinter, Fell into the foaming brine. Ruby lips above the water, Blowing bubbles, soft and fine, But, alas, I was no swimmer, So I lost my Clementine. How I missed her! How I missed her, How I missed my Clementine, But I kissed her little sister, I forgot my Clementine.      5. \"Bingo\" The earliest recorded version from 1888 adds two verses after the one that spells out the famous farmer's dog's name. They went like this:      Thys Franklyn, syrs, he brewed goode ayle, And he called it Rare good Styngo! S, T, Y, N, G, O! He call'd it Rare goode Styngo! Nowe is notte thys a prettie song?

Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in an unknown location in Iraq after his capture in 2003.    According to a CBS report, Hussein claimed he didn't anticipate that the United States would invade Iraq over WMD, agent George Piro said on \"60 Minutes,\" scheduled for Sunday broadcast.    \"For him, it was critical that he was seen as still the strong, defiant Saddam. He thought that (faking having the weapons) would prevent the Iranians from reinvading Iraq,\" said Piro.    During the nearly seven months Piro talked to Hussein, the agent hinted to the Iraqi that he answered directly to President Bush, CBS said in a posting on its Web site.    \"He told me he initially miscalculated ... President Bush's intentions. He thought the United States would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four-day aerial attack,\" Piro said. \"He survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack.\"    \"He didn't believe the U.S. would invade?\" Correspondent Scott Pelley asked.    \"No, not initially,\" Piro answered.    Once it was clear that an invasion was imminent, Hussein asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks, Piro said. \"And at that point, it would go into what he called the secret war,\" the agent said, referring to the insurgency.    But Piro said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of Hussein's plan. \"Well, he would like to take credit for the insurgency,\" he said.    Hussein had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that, Piro said.    \"He wanted to pursue all of WMD ... to reconstitute his entire WMD program.\"    Hussein said he was proud he eluded U.S. authorities who searched for him for nine months after the U.S.-led invasion, Piro said.    \"What he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us,\" Piro said. \"He told me he changed ... the way he traveled.

Attorney Byron Potts says his client is not being pressured to recant her story.      \"She is recanting her entire story,\" attorney Byron Potts told reporters in Columbus, Ohio, about his client, Megan Williams, who moved there after the incident. \"She says it did not happen. She fabricated it.\"      He added, \"She wanted to get back at her boyfriend. She was mad at him.\"      In 2007, police acting on a tip found the black woman in a trailer with cuts and bruises. She said she had been stabbed in the leg and beaten, sexually assaulted, forced to eat feces and subjected to a racial slur by her white captors.      The suspects included a mother and son, a separate mother and daughter, and two men. All are still jailed, according to the prosecutor who handled the case.      The incident, which drew extensive media coverage, stirred outrage around the country. Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton called for the incident to be investigated as a hate crime.      Last year, all six defendants pleaded guilty and were given terms of up to 40 years in prison.      Potts said his client was coming forward \"to right the wrong perpetrated on these six individuals.\" He added that she told him all her injuries except for the bruises on her face were self-inflicted. The bruises, he said, were from an altercation she had had with her then-boyfriend before the incident in question.      Potts described Williams' feelings as \"total remorse; that's why she's coming forward. She is remorseful for having these people spend time in jail.\"      Asked if she was being pressured to recant, he said, \"No, she's not being pressured into this.\"      Williams had been expected to speak herself, but Potts said she would not appear before the news media because she was afraid for her safety.      He said she was \"fully aware\" that she might face criminal charges, \"but she still wanted to go forward with this.\"      Brian Abraham, the former Logan County prosecutor who handled the case, defended the convictions. \"The case wasn't based on her statements,\" he said, noting that Williams never testified in the case. \"The case was based on the evidence discovered by the police, including the confessions of the six defendants.\"      He added, \"All six of them have been in jail without filing appeals. If they file something afterwards, the evidence was pretty overwhelming for the charges on which they were convicted.\"      The current county prosecutor, John Bennett, said he could not comment on whether the case would be reopened. He said he represented one of the suspects in 2007 and so would let a judge decide how to handle the potential conflict of interest.      Sharpton said, \"If they are being held under false information and she misled authorities, and if the authorities went solely on her testimony, then they should be released.\" But he added, \"If there are other circumstances around the recanting, we should know what they are.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/01d5b7cf16d87db5a2bed267d83aac584f58f325.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who accuses Dems of \"double standard\"?", "id": "108645", "answers": [{"text": "Steele", "answer_start": 5130}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the Republican Party and a leading GOP senator called on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to give up his post Sunday, following the publication of remarks he made about President Obama's race in 2008.      A new book quotes Reid, D-Nevada, as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could be successful as a black candidate in part because of his \"light-skinned\" appearance and speaking patterns \"with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.\"      The remarks were \"embarrassing and racially insensitive,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, in a statement to CNN.      GOP Chairman Michael Steele, on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" said: \"Racism and racist conversations have no place today in America.\"      Steele also was on the defensive for a remark he made last week that members of both parties have called a racial slur. In an interview with Fox News, Steele used the phrase \"honest injun.\"      The Congressional Black Caucus has accepted Reid's apology and is dismissing calls for him to step down as majority leader.      Rep. Barbara Lee, chairwoman of the caucus, issued the following statement: \"I have had an opportunity to speak with Senator Reid and he apologized for his unfortunate remarks concerning the president, and he understands the gravity of such remarks. There are too many issues like the economy, job creation and energy for these regrettable comments to distract us from the work that must be done on behalf of the American people.\"      Democrats also rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal. Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, said \"the case is closed\" following Reid's round of apologies.      Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who 20 years ago became the nation's first elected African-American governor, also rejected calls for Reid's ouster.      \"I think that what Reid was giving was a personal opinion, which wasn't affecting the laws or the operation of the dispensation of justice in our country,\" Wilder told CNN's \"State of the Union.\"      But he said he believes the incident \"illustrates the need for more open discussion about race.\"      Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.      Democrats rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal, and Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.      \"Sen. Reid will stay in his position as majority leader and will run for re-election,\" his spokesman said.      \"As the leader in the fight to pass the Voting Rights Act and legislation banning hate crimes, Sen. Reid has a long record of addressing issues that are important to the African-American community. His Republican critics who are looking to politicize the issue can't say the same.\"      Reid's controversial quote is in the book \"Game Change,\" due in stores Monday. The authors write that \"Reid was convinced, in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination.\"      In a statement to CNN, Reid said, \"I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words.\"      \"I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans for my improper comments. I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda,\" Reid said.      In his defense, he pointed to his efforts to integrate the Las Vegas strip and the gaming industry, among other legislation favored by African-American voters.      \"I have worked hard to advance issues important to the African-American community,\" he said.      And the senate leader called Obama on Saturday afternoon to apologize for the remarks. In a statement issued after the call, Obama said, \"As far as I am concerned, the book is closed.\"      \"Harry Reid called me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today,\" the president said. \"I accepted Harry's apology without question because I've known him for years, I've seen the passionate leadership he's shown on issues of social justice and I know what's in his heart.\"      An aide to the senator told CNN that Reid also offered apologies to several prominent African-American political figures, including House Democrats Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Barbara Lee of California; the Rev. Al Sharpton; CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile; NAACP chairman Julian Bond; and the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Wade Henderson.      Steele, the GOP's first African-American chairman, was asked about the remarks on both \"Meet the Press\" and \"Fox News Sunday.\" He told NBC on Sunday he believes Reid is out of touch with \"how African-Americans generally feel\" about sensitive issues.      Steele was asked by NBC whether he believes the situation is similar to one involving former Sen. Trent Lott, who lost his post as Senate majority leader in 2002 after saying that the nation would have been better off if one-time segregationist candidate Strom Thurmond had been elected president.      \"Oh, yeah. There is a big double standard here,\" Steele said on NBC.      Steele added: \"When Democrats get caught saying racist things, you know, an apology is enough.\"      Steele said that if a Republican senator had made the same remark Reid did, Steele himself and the Democratic Party \"would be screaming for his head very much as they were with Trent Lott.\"      Cornyn, in his statement, also accused Democrats of following a \"double standard,\" and noted that they had pushed Lott to step down.      \"As we await his explanation, Sen. Reid should do the right thing, follow the example that he himself set in 2002, and step down as majority leader,\" Cornyn said.      Kaine shot back against those arguments.      \"Anybody looking at Trent Lott's statements praising somebody who had been a pro-segregation candidate for president will see that there is no comparison between those comments and those of Sen. Reid,\" Kaine told NBC.      The comments \"were in the context of praising the senator and acknowledging that the senator could be a great president, but they were still insensitive,\" Kaine said.      Asked whether Reid should resign, he said, \"Absolutely not. ... We're moving on.\"      Nevada state Senate Majority Leader Steven Horsford, who is African-American, affirmed his support for Reid in a statement Saturday.      \"While I am disappointed in Sen. Reid's comment and choice of words, I accept his apology,\" said Horsford, a Democrat. \"I have known Sen. Reid for many years and he has consistently been supportive of advancing the interests of the African-American community as he has for all Nevadans and all Americans.\"      Steele, meanwhile, was asked about his remark in a Fox News interview last week that the GOP platform \"is one of the best political documents that's been written in the last 25 years, 'honest injun' on that.\"      \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace noted that lawmakers from both parties have called that a racial slur.      \"Well, if it is, I apologize for it. It's not an intent to be a racial slur. I wasn't intending to say a racial slur at all,\" Steele said.

U.S. President Jimmy Carter watches UK PM James Callaghan speak at a 1979 meeting in Guadeloupe.    Papers released by the National Archives, under the 30-year rule, reveal that Royal Air Force fighter jets only had sufficient ammunition for two days of combat and the Royal Navy would fail to defend the country from Russian submarines.    The army would have been too over-stretched to cope with a widescale campaign of sabotage and subversion by Soviet special forces, the papers show.    Prime Minister James Callaghan called the situation a \"scandal\" when he discovered the scale of the problem and demanded resignations among the military.    \"Heaven help us if there is a war!\" he scrawled on one note. But ministers could do little until the Tornado fighter plane became available in the mid-1980s along with other military hardware.    The problem became clear when senior intelligence officers warned in late 1977 that, in the event of a conventional war, the Russians could unleash up to 200 bombers and 18 submarines against the UK.    The assessment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was that British forces would be unable to cope.    \"UK forces cannot match the threat postulated by the JIC assessment,\" the chiefs noted in January 1978 in a document marked Top Secret UK Eyes Alpha.    \"Air defenses would be outweighed because aircraft would be outnumbered and stocks of air defense munitions would sustain operations for only two or three days.    \"Maritime forces need better anti-submarine weapons, and face a massive threat from submarine and air-launched missiles and also from mines; the most serious deficiency is in numbers.    \"The army in the UK would, until mobilization is complete, have insufficient forces to meet its commitments; after mobilization of the reserves, a process taking between 15-20 days, the Army would be able to counter the currently assessed Soviet land threat during the initial stages of the war but, lacking supporting arms and logistic support, it would be inadequate to deal with any more significant threat, including sabotage or subversion on a wide scale.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/47bab8eb9a684a4f9e8c87af240adc2ee7cb8806.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where was the sign stolen from?", "id": "108651", "answers": [{"text": "Auschwitz", "answer_start": 98}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- A sign synonymous with the Nazi work camps of World War II was stolen overnight from the Auschwitz Concentration Camp memorial in Poland, police said Friday.

He has indicated he would respond positively to any approach from Real Madrid, but is sure to take on board the advice of Maradona who twice led Napoli to the Serie A title after joining the Italian club from Barcelona.    Meanwhile, West Ham face a fresh inquiry after the FA and Premier League launched an investigation relating to dealings with Tevez's representatives after the club had initially been fined \u00a35.5m for breaching league rules over third-party agreements.    It follows the findings of an arbitration tribunal in favour of Sheffield United and against West Ham last year which decided Tevez should not have been able to play for the Hammers at the end of the 2006-07 season.    Premier League West Ham insist that they have nothing to hide."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/e5b248ede2f007f1a42f14210cc7f76e55e75241.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did Mark Hughes say?", "id": "108657", "answers": [{"text": "he had to attend to some \"urgent family business\".", "answer_start": 369}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Premier League big-spenders Manchester City are set to fine record signing Robinho for his training ground walk-out in Tenerife last week.  Manchester City have confirmed Robinho will be fined following his Tenerife walk-out last week.

It was expected that Hughes would fine the \u00c2\u00a332.5 million ($46m) striker approximately two weeks wages, which would be touching \u00c2\u00a3200,000 ($283.5m), but there have also been suggestions that the City manager would not impose a punishment at all.  However, Hughes has denied that allegation, confirming that Robinho will be punished.  \"I've had a talk with Robinho,\" Hughes told the UK's Press Association. \"I have read some of the things that have been said this morning but nothing could be further from the truth.  \"I have told Robby about the situation and our intention is to fine him.

Anne Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office in Amsterdam.    It could be the description of almost any young girl growing up in Europe. But this is how Eva Schloss remembers her childhood friend Anne Frank, who had she not died in a Nazi concentration camp, would have celebrated her 80th birthday this week.    Schloss described Frank, whose account of hiding from Jewish persecution in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam is one of the world's mostly widely-read books, as a spunky young schoolgirl with a passion for storytelling that often got her into trouble.    \"She got her diary in 1942, so obviously her father knew she was interested in writing and I know she told stories,\" said Schloss.    \"She talked a lot and she was called Mrs Quack Quack. Very often she used to write hundreds of lines [at school] of 'I'm not going to talk so much,' and so on -- but obviously she had a lot to tell.\"    In some ways the two friends lived parallel lives -- but tragically they had very different outcomes.  Watch more about Schloss' story \u00bb    Schloss and Frank both came from Jewish families who fled to Holland to escape the wave of anti-Semitism spreading across Europe as the Nazis rose to power in Germany ahead of the Second World War.    But while Schloss was more of an introvert, Frank loved the limelight. Schloss said: \"I was actually quite shy and she was the center of attention. We had steps where we sat, and she had a crowd of children around her.    \"She was a big flirt -- she loved boys. She was always showing us who was her boyfriend at that particular time. She was always interested in her clothes. Her style, she always changed it. Sometimes she had curls, then she had straight hair.\"    Schloss says they were unaware of the full scale of what was going on around them as war escalated across Europe, placing their lives in increasing jeopardy.    \"Our parents really protected us so there was no talk about the horrendous things which happened.    \"You couldn't go out anymore after 8 o'clock, but for a 11 to 12 year old it didn't matter so much. Or not going to the cinema -- we were upset about those little things which we couldn't do, but we really didn't really take it seriously at that time.\"    Like Frank, Schloss was also forced into hiding when the Nazis took control of Holland.    Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office. But Schloss and her family had to split up. Schloss stayed with her mother while her father and brother hid elsewhere. She and her mother moved around, staying in seven different hiding places over a two-year period.    Eventually both families were betrayed and were sent to concentration camps, where Frank died at the age of 15.    Schloss said: \"My father and brother were betrayed by a Dutch nurse who was a double agent, and all four of us were arrested and taken to the headquarters to be interrogated.    \"I didn't know anything, which was a good thing. So eventually they realized this and they gave up torturing me. Within two days we were put on a transport to Auschwitz.\"    Of her family, only Schloss and her mother survived Auschwitz, one of the most notorious concentration camps, located in southern Poland.    Today Schloss, who has just celebrated her own 80th birthday, has a husband, three daughters and five grandchildren.    Schloss says it took her decades to rebuild her life, with the help of Frank's father Otto, who also survived incarceration in a concentration camp.    She met Otto in August 1945, when he showed her Frank's diary.    Schloss said: \"He read a few passages but he always burst into tears. It took me 20 years. I was really unhappy, but it was Otto who came to our apartment to talk to us, and he helped me a lot. He had lost everybody.    \"Her book, she [Frank] made people aware of what happened. There are many messages. She believed in the goodness of mankind.    \"People always ask me, what she would have done. I guess we will never know. But I guess she would have gone into politics -- she was a fighter. It's a pity, but also -- maybe her diary would have never been published.\"    CNN's Don Riddell contributed to this story."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f372b28e3d1f74d60aa8ee29d7bdd49a6e7f9779.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does she fear?", "id": "108662", "answers": [{"text": "I do not want to be the \"Look", "answer_start": 2940}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(InStyle.com) -- A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born.  The Ing\u00e9nue: \"This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,\" Heigl says. \"I like simple hair and makeup.\"  There has been a self-tanning mishap  As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late.  Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fianc\u00e9, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets.  Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products.  \"I love everything new,\" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on \"Grey's Anatomy,\" just started a production company at Fox. \"When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca.\"  She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January.  Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit \"Knocked Up\" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl.  These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like.  KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat.  IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign.  KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth.  IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks?  KH: It was fun. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat.  IS: Do you ever go without makeup?  KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the \"Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup\" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products.  IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge?  KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept.  IS: How do you think you express your personality through style?  KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again.  As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm \"preparing\" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat.  IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding?  KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, \"I'm done.\" Everyone says, \"You just know when you put that dress on.\" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling.  IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months?  KH: My poor mother is probably like, \"Why, God? Why?\" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress.  IS: Does your fianc\u00e9 have any particular opinions about your look?  KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing.  IS: Would you ever wear a wig out?  KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out.  IS: How would you describe your skin?  KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse.  IS: How do you treat a breakout?  KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine.  IS: What do you always carry in your bag?  KH: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O. Bigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good.  IS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood.  KH: I train with Harley Pasternak. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet. I first said, \"I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl.\" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, \"I just want you to be healthy.\" A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it. For me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible.

Stenson stripped down to the bare essentials -- a pair of white boxer shorts -- before wading into the mud to hack out his ball after an wayward tee shot.

The reported sentence is \"wholly unjustified and represents further harassment of embassy staff for going about their normal and legitimate duties,\" Miliband had said earlier, in a statement issued Wednesday.    Rassam is one of several British embassy employees arrested in the wake of Iran's disputed June 12 presidential election. Thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the official results declaring President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner.    Iran accused Britain and the United States of fomenting the unrest.    Rassam was put on trial in August. The European Union, France and the United Kingdom denounced the proceeding.    Rassam's lawyer has not officially been informed of the embassy worker's sentence, and he does not know where Rassam is, he told Iranian media.    Abdolsamad Khorramshahi told the Fars News Agency that the terms of Rassam's bail did not prevent him from leaving the country. He said Rassam had been in Iran recently, but he did not know his current whereabouts.    He said he could not express an opinion on the verdict before the court officially informs him of it, which he said normally happens after it is issued.    The European Union condemned the reported verdict as \"unjustified and harsh,\" and urged \"the Iranian authorities to overturn it swiftly,\" the Swedish presidency of the 27-nation bloc said in a statement Thursday.    \"Any action against one EU country (a citizen or member of embassy staff) is considered an action against the entire EU, and will be treated accordingly,\" the statement said.    France also condemned the sentencing of Rassam.    Miliband said he understood the sentence could be appealed and urged \"the authorities to conduct this quickly and overturn this harsh sentence.\"    \"This will be seen as an attack against the entire diplomatic community in Iran,\" he said in a statement late Wednesday.

Al-Shabaab militants ride through Mogadishu, Somalia, after a religious gathering in September.    The U.S. government, concerned about the challenges in delivering assistance in a country wracked by civil war, says allegations that Al-Shabaab is stopping aid from reaching the people are under review.    Although one U.S. government source said aid continues to flow to Somalia and hasn't been suspended, another said aid might not reach \"some parts of the country\" because of Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked terror group that is trying to overthrow the government.    Located in the Horn of Africa, Somalia has long been a lawless, war-ravaged nation. The United Nations says that nearly half the population is dependent on humanitarian assistance, and one in five children are acutely malnourished.    Somalia has suffered through five consecutive seasons of drought, and the ongoing conflict has caused more than a million people to be displaced.    Kiki Gbeho, head of office for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Somalia, said the United States is reviewing whether its aid helps fund Al-Shabaab.    The U.N. office, in a report issued in September, said the U.S. delay in reaching a decision on humanitarian funding \"is already impacting on many agencies and their programmes.\"    The United Nations estimates that 60 percent of the people it needs to reach with emergency assistance live in areas controlled by Al-Shabaab.    \"According to humanitarian principles, we have to serve people and need to deal with those in charge,\" Gbeho said.    Peter Smerdon, chief spokesman for the World Food Program, the agency responsible for delivering aid to Somalia, would not comment on the U.S. funding controversy but said investigations into whether Al-Shabaab is assisted by U.N. aid assistance are \"ongoing.\"    Food supplies could run out for millions of Somalis in the next few weeks, according to the United Nations. The U.S. government is traditionally the biggest donor for food assistance.    The issue of breakdowns in humanitarian aid in Somalia has long concerned the United States. A senior administration official and an administration official spoke about the issue on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.    The senior U.S. administration official said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Transitional Federal Government President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed discussed in August how the \"delivery of services\" to the Somali people be broadened.    Clinton said publicly in Nairobi that the United States continues to provide \"humanitarian assistance to the Somali people where delivery is feasible and effective.\"    The administration official said that the aid has never stopped, adding that food bound for the World Food Program in Somalia is on a vessel and should arrive in a few weeks.    The senior administration official said, \"We are working with groups there to ensure that we can deliver assistance without having to pay off Al-Shabaab in the process. It does mean that aid may get to certain parts of the country but not others.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/5e4ac4c534051c6cf72d58389d9e6aca52403472.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What do inmates in Texas have?", "id": "108689", "answers": [{"text": "cell phones", "answer_start": 45}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- In the black market of prison life, cell phones have become perhaps the hottest commodity. Now, Texas is among a growing number of state governments going after them.    Hundreds of contraband cell phones were found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008.    Tiny, easy to hide and an unmonitored link for convicts to the outside world, cell phones are valuable contraband, fetching a greater asking price from convicts than some shipments of illegal drugs.    John Moriarty, inspector general for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said that one phone can fetch as much as $2,000.    \"It takes one crooked prison worker to populate a whole prison unit with them,\" he said.    More than 1,200 wireless phones sit in law enforcement evidence rooms, all found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008.    Moriarty is the investigator and bloodhound the state of Texas uses to trail the illegal traffic.    \"These are not stupid people,\" he said of the coordinated efforts to slip phones into the prison and hide them. \"There are a lot of hands in between and they all want a piece of the action.\"    Accomplices on the outside vary from family members, to friends to fellow criminals who buy or steal the phones and charge them with minutes.    The contraband is then moved through an elaborate series of drop points and usually ferried into the walls of a prison by a guard or trustee -- an escape engineered in reverse. Finding the dirty prison employee is often the key.    \"Some of these guys make next to nothing, so you can see how easy it could be to corrupt them,\" Moriarty said.    State Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and the chair of the state senate's Criminal Justice Committee, became an ally of Moriarty's after one phone call in October.    He picked up a phone slip from his secretary and called the number on it -- only to realize he had returned a call to a death row inmate's cell phone.    The inmate, he said, was Richard Tabler -- a convicted double murderer who was sharing a wireless phone with nine other inmates.    \"At first I thought it was a hoax,\" said Whitmire, who said he called the state justice board and \"read them the riot act.\"    Whitmire is one of the sponsors of a bill in the Texas Legislature that would crack down on convicts caught with phones and allow prison systems to monitor and detect cell signals. It's en route to Gov. Rick Perry's desk after clearing both houses of the legislature this week.    Other efforts are under way at both the state and federal level.    In January, U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, introduced legislation that would let prisons jam cell-phone signals within their walls.    Last month, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley asked the federal government for permission to do so in his state.    Prison officials in Arizona are training dogs to sniff out cell phones."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/4d5867a665c151f8679a4d7ec0917a20b97dd9e2.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "who is Felipe Calderon?", "id": "108690", "answers": [{"text": "Mexican counterpart,", "answer_start": 191}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Politically sensitive issues such as immigration, border security, drug trafficking and trade took center stage in Washington on Wednesday as President Obama welcomed his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, to the White House.      Both leaders used the occasion -- the fourth time they have met for bilateral talks -- to take sharp aim at Arizona's new law meant to crack down on illegal immigrants. Calderon characterized the measure as discriminatory; Obama called it a \"misdirected expression of frustration.\"      The leaders criticized the law while meeting with reporters shortly after Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rolled out the red carpet for Calderon in a formal White House arrival ceremony.      U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala joined their husbands for the occasion, which was to be followed by a state dinner Wednesday night. Calderon is to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday.      \"Our progress today marks another step forward in a new era of cooperation and partnership between our countries, a partnership based on mutual interests, mutual respect and mutual responsibility,\" Obama said.      Calderon said the United States and Mexico now face a series of common challenges, including climate change and organized crime, which is a rising threat to border stability.      But what ultimately \"turns us into good neighbors\" is a common belief in \"freedom, justice and democracy,\" he said.      Obama ticked through a list of items he said the two leaders had agreed upon during their meeting. On the economy, he said, they had agreed to streamline regulations while strengthening protection of intellectual property. To facilitate trade, they had reaffirmed a \"commitment to a 21st-century border that is modern, secure and efficient.\"      He also pledged to expand joint initiatives promoting renewable energy and \"smart grid\" technology.      Turning to illegal drug and weapons trafficking, Obama noted that his administration is now screening 100 percent of south-bound rail cargo. Moving in the other direction, Mexican authorities in recent years have seized 45,000 weapons that could be traced to the United States.      Obama also cited new initiatives to cut U.S. demand for illegal drugs.      \"As your partner, we'll give you the support you need to prevail ... against the drug cartels that have unleashed horrific violence in so many communities,\" Obama told Calderon.      Drug violence claimed 6,500 lives in Mexico last year. But Calderon said 90 percent of the casualties from the war on drugs are criminals fighting each other, adding that the cartels \"are not winning.\"      \"The Mexican gangs are passing through a very unstable process ... and fighting each other and that explains most of those casualties,\" Calderon said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\"      He acknowledged, however, that innocent people have also been killed.      Obama also noted Mexico's current seat on the U.N. Security Council, highlighting the two countries' agreement on possible sanctions against Iran to stop Tehran's current nuclear program.      The issue of Arizona's new immigration law, however, consumed most of the leaders' time during their meeting with reporters. The measure, which will allow law enforcement officers to ask for proof of legal residency of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction, has drawn widespread criticism in Mexico.      Critics contend, among other things, that the law will lead to racial profiling against Hispanic residents.      Later Wednesday, Calderon acknowledged that immigration is the biggest challenge Mexico is facing with the United States.      \"It is provoking a lot of tensions between our people,\" Calderon said. \"This is a phenomenon that we need to solve. ... And the best way to solve that is creating new jobs in Mexico and that is exactly what we are trying to do.\"      Calderon said Mexico is working to change its own immigration policies to address criticisms from officials in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico who claim they're only trying to do in their states what Mexico is doing in the southern part of its country.      Calderon said that illegal immigration has not been a crime in Mexico since last year.      \"In the past, Mexican authorities were in an unfortunate way in the treatment (of immigrants),\" he said. \"We changed already the law and that is different today. We are trying to write a new story.\"      Regarding Arizona's tough new immigration law, Calderon said the potential for racial profiling with the statute \"is against any sense of human rights.\"      Obama said he thinks the Arizona law \"has the potential of being applied in a discriminatory fashion. ... A fair reading of the language of the statute indicates that it gives the possibility of individuals who are deemed suspicious of being illegal immigrants from being harassed or arrested.      \"The judgments that are going to be made in applying this law are troublesome,\" he noted.      Obama noted that he has directed the Justice Department \"to look very carefully at the language of this law to see whether it comports both with our core values and existing legal standards, as well as the fact that the federal government is ultimately the one charged with immigration policy.\"      Obama said he'll make some decisions about how to address the law after he gets a final report from the Justice officials.      A broad coalition of civil rights groups filed a class-action lawsuit against the measure Monday, arguing that it violates the U.S. Constitution's equal protection and free speech guarantees, among other things.      In Arizona, the city councils of Tucson and Flagstaff have also decided to challenge the law in court.      A majority of Americans, however, appears to back to the measure. Fifty-nine percent of adults nationwide supported the law in a May 6-9 Pew Research Center Poll. Thirty-two percent opposed it.      The Arizona law, Obama asserted Wednesday, \"expresses some of the frustrations that the American people have had in not fixing a broken immigration system, and, frankly, the failures of the federal government to get this done. I'm sympathetic to those frustrations.\"      Obama repeated his call for comprehensive immigration reform but said such a measure can't pass without Republican support.      A Mexican official familiar with arrangements for Calderon's visit cautioned that it would be wrong to let the controversy over Arizona's law overwhelm the rest of the visit.      \"It will not define the visit or the relationship,\" the Mexican official said. \"The U.S.-Mexican relationship is much more rich and diverse than one issue.\"      A senior Obama administration official, however, acknowledged that \"this is an issue that has resonated in Mexico (and) is of deep concern to the Mexican government.\"      This month, Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Arturo Sarukhan, warned of \"a worrying surge\" of anti-immigrant sentiments. He warned that the Arizona law might \"poison the well from which our two nations have found and should continue to find inspiration for a joint future of prosperity, security, tolerance and justice.\"      CNN's Charley Keyes and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/f155e440ae4f77514f9ba24dfb2a4360fa3c0653.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who won first Test?", "id": "108694", "answers": [{"text": "South Africa", "answer_start": 1951}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN)  -- South Africa inflicted the first home series defeat on Australia in almost 16 years as they wrapped up a nine-wicket win over the world's number one ranked Test nation in Melbourne on Tuesday.  South African captain Graeme Smith led from the front with 75 as his team wrapped up victory.  Captain Graeme Smith hit a fluent 75 as his side successfully passed a modest victory target of 183 on the final day at the MCG to take an unassailable 2-0 lead.  It was the South African's first-ever Test series triumph in Australia and victory in the third and final match in Sydney will see them leapfrog the home side at the top of the global rankings.  Hashim Amla (30 not out) scored the winning runs shortly after lunch as South Africa became the first team to overcome Australia at home since the West Indies in 1992-93.  South Africa were never under any pressure in their run chase and did not lose a wicket until just before lunch when the inspirational Smith was trapped leg before wicket by Nathan Hauritz.  Smith had dominated a 121-run opening stand with Neil McKenzie, hitting 10 boundaries.  McKenzie struggled to a half century and survived strong lbw shouts from Brett Lee, who was bowling despite an injured foot that will keep him out of the Sydney Test.  South Africa's victory was set up by a brilliant maiden Test century from JP Duminy, who shared a stunning 180-run ninth wicket partnership with pace bowler Dale Steyn.  It gave the tourists a priceless 65-run lead on first innings before man of the match Steyn worked his magic with the ball as Australia were bowled out on the fourth day for 247 in their second innings.  The pugnacious Smith was virtually lost for words in his victory speech.  \"It has been such a special moment for all of us, it has been an incredible team effort,\" he said.  \"I have been smiling non-stop since we hit the winning runs.  \"To be 2-0 up after this game was something we only dreamt of.\"  South Africa won the first Test in Perth from an unlikely position, chasing 414 for victory for the loss of only four wickets."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/6eda84d80d9c9d9f2fb9024eb0765131436d6c12.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Was George Bush at the convention?", "id": "108696", "answers": [{"text": "the", "answer_start": 998}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) -- Sex columnist Dan Savage and author of the popular syndicated sex advice column \"Savage Love,\" made his way to St. Paul, Minnesota, to attend the Republican National Convention where he is filming a piece for HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher.\"    Sex columnist Dan Savage is reporting on the GOP convention for HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher.\"    Planted in the CNN Grill, Savage shares his thoughts on John McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, tells us what a sex columnist is doing at a political convention, and gives us his take on who's sexier, Democrats or Republicans.    Here are five questions for Dan Savage:    CNN: You're here because you're a lifelong Republican?    Savage: No, that's not true, actually. I'm a Democrat, although I am a registered Republican in Washington State, but just to drive the Washington State Republican Party up the wall.    CNN: Why are you here?    Savage: I was here to see if I could find any evidence of George W. Bush at the convention. And I found very little. There was that satellite feed. I bought this button [points to Dick Cheney button on his shirt]. This will be the only time you'll see Dick Cheney at the convention is when you see me walk by with this button ... I wasn't able to purchase it here ... I mean you talk to Republican delegates walking around, a lot of them will admit that George Bush has been a major disappointment and they're happy that he's not here. And one of the reasons that they're happy he's not here is that they don't want America reminded that four years ago and eight years ago, these same delegates ... thought George Bush walked on water.    CNN: Why would \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" send a sex columnist to cover the Republican National Convention?    Savage: Because when you're a sex writer in America you have to write about politics because politicians will not stop obsessing about it -- screwing around with people's sex lives. Often when I write about politics in \"Savage Love,\" my sex advice column, people write to me and say, \"you're a sex columnist, stick to sex.\" And I'll say -- I usually respond -- \"I'll be able to stick to sex when politicians stick to politics and leave our sex lives alone, and stop politicizing our sex lives.\" But they do. And it's one of the major differences between the two political parties, our sexual issues. And so my view is very relevant, I feel very at home here.    CNN: Any thoughts on McCain's running mate choice?    Savage: I think Palin has been the clown car of the vice presidential nominee. You never know what's going to pop out of Palin next.    CNN: Who's sexier: Republicans or Democrats?    Savage: Well, there's just something about those Young Republicans. They're very sexy. They're very tense and nervous. I spoke to a lot of them because I've been running around the convention asking teenagers throughout the convention if they're virgins or not. 'Cuz I feel like I have a right to know because we've invested over a billion dollars in abstinence education programs under George Bush."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/fafd89b36bc417ca242d666a8d9cfd5e77bab922.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did the plane crash?", "id": "108697", "answers": [{"text": "Koh Samui airport,", "answer_start": 370}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)  -- A Bangkok Airways plane crashed at an airport at a resort island in Thailand, killing the pilot and injuring 37 people Tuesday, aviation officials said.

James Hunter has received raves for his recordings, but has yet to break through to big-time success.    Midway through a lengthy tour, it's nice to know his sense of humor is intact. The boyish 46-year-old British retro-R&B singer is in a dressing room at the Sunset Strip's House of Blues, sitting in a throne-like chair festooned with Mexican Day of the Dead skulls.    It's oddly fitting. Like that festival, Hunter is remembering -- through his music -- those who are no longer with us. His classic soul-inspired sound and concert style harkens back to the golden days of R&B and the men who practiced it: Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke and guitarist Lowman Pauling, among others.    \"I think I probably stole a couple of tricks from people who were already dead by the time I started,\" he replies, when asked about his stage moves. Indeed, an hour later he's on stage and it's clear that if you put him in the \"Back to the Future\" DeLorean, traveled back to 1955 and dropped him off with Marvin Berry's band at the \"Enchantment Under the Sea\" dance, he'd be right at home.  Watch Hunter perform for a sound check \u00bb    That authentic old-school sound has made him a cult favorite among jazz and blues aficionados. His first two albums -- 2006's \"People Gonna Talk\" and last year's \"The Hard Way\" -- were acclaimed by critics and the cognoscenti, with the Boston Globe calling \"The Hard Way\" \"one of the year's smoothest and best discs.\" He's also earned praise as a dazzling live performer, one who is known for guitar acrobatics performed with a smile.    But he has yet to achieve the mainstream success of British retro-soul contemporaries Amy Winehouse, Duffy and Adele. Could it be because they've found a way to blend contemporary lyrics with an older sound?    Hunter acknowledges he doesn't do enough of that in his own music: \"I think that's my downfall, to be honest. I think they picked up on a trick that I'm trying, that I've mastered. I mean, I think they're as much immersed in contemporary stuff as the old days. I think that's pretty cool. I'm trying to do that.    \"Stylistically, I'm more embedded, not in tradition -- I mean I'm not into genres -- but styles, you know,\" he continues. \"The sound of things. I've got my preference in the sound and stuff. But, you know, I think I can afford to go their way a little bit, not because it's successful, but because it works.\"    Interestingly, few American acts have embraced the retro-soul sound with the fervor of their British counterparts. Hunter has his theories on why that's the case.    \"It could be because you guys invented it, you know. I think it's possible,\" he says. \"I'm not sure these days, but initially you had the Stones and people like that, even the Beatles who were much more in awe in this American music than Americans were. It all tends to be on your doorstep and you tend to be more cavalier to the stuff that's already there. It's like the thing when John Lennon told the reporters that he wanted to see Muddy Waters and they said, 'Where's that?' \"    But despite the love he has for the music of the classic soul era, Hunter understands that going forward, a healthy irreverence is what will keep it fresh for audiences -- and himself.    \"I think the downfall of any type of music is to treat it with too much reverence, because the people at the time weren't treating it with reverence and they were sort of bashing it out, that was the beauty of it, the spontaneity,\" he says. \"But, when people are trying to preserve stuff -- you've got to be loyal to this or that kind of music -- that's so much nonsense.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/23e0d4f2bccf9796eed36fcfc5934093dcc80a99.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who approved a bill allowing use of hybrid embryos in stem cell research?", "id": "108703", "answers": [{"text": "British parliament", "answer_start": 354}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Opponents of controversial plans to use hybrid human-animal embryos for research spoke out Tuesday, calling the practice unnecessary, unnatural, and reprehensible a day after British lawmakers voted to allow it.    Advocates of hybrid cells say animal eggs from which a nucleus has been removed are simply \"empty shells.\"    The British parliament debated the issue Monday as part of its discussion of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill, which will update legislation on reproduction and embryos.    \"Crossing the species barrier in this way is deeply, deeply reprehensible, undesirable,\" said Josephine Quintavalle, a bioethicist who founded Comment on Reproductive Ethics (CORE).    The research involves emptying an animal egg and filling it with human cells. The resulting embryo is allowed to develop for 14 days -- during which time scientists harvest the stem cells -- before being destroyed.    Scientists hope working with those stem cells will lead to treatments for serious conditions like motor neuron disease, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, and they say using hybrids overcomes the shortage of human embryos.    \"The use of animal eggs will provide a valuable resource to embryo research scientists,\" argued Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo.    Lawmakers were allowed to vote according to conscience and the legislation passed comfortably, though not without opposition.    \"If an embryo could talk, perhaps it would echo what Mary Shelley did say in 'Frankenstein': 'I, the miserable and the abandoned, an abortion to be spurned out and kicked and trampled on,'\" Conservative Party lawmaker Edward Leigh told parliament.    Supporters of the research dispute the numerous \"Frankenstein\" references and say it does not create monsters.    Stephen Minger, director of the stem cell biology lab at King's College in London, said the practice begins with the removal of an animal egg's nucleus, which contains all of the chromosomes, thereby stripping the egg of its \"species identity.\"    \"It's an empty shell,\" Minger said. \"By putting a human cell -- not just a nucleus, but in our case an intact human cell -- into the egg, you confer a human genetic identity onto that.\"    The approved bill creates a legal framework for the scientific research on hybrid embryos.    British Prime Minister Gordon Brown feels so strongly about the benefits of the research that he wrote a column Sunday in The Observer newspaper calling it an \"inherently moral endeavor,\" but ethics groups and others disagree.    \"I think we all know that we don't reproduce with animals,\" Quintavalle said. \"Humans do not reproduce with animals. Whether it's done in the laboratory or not doesn't make it right.\"    Quintavalle urged the government and the scientific community to wait until a new method of research emerges which does not mix animal and human genetic material.    Human Genetics Alert, a secular independent watchdog, said it found defects among existing hybrid embryos which raise doubts about whether mixed embryos can produce useful stem cells.    \"I'm very, very unimpressed with the scientific case for doing that,\" said David King, a former molecular biologist who now heads the HGA. \"The science is so weak and the ethical concerns are so significant, I think you have to weigh that.\"    The scientific arguments in favor of the research have been \"overhyped,\" King said, and offer no hope of a cure for those suffering with genetic disorders.    \"Very little, I think, will come out of it and I think hopes are being raised that will be cruelly disappointed,\" King said.    The Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill was drawn up in 1990, when science and government were unaware that current hybrid-embryo developments were possible, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health told CNN.    The original bill did allow the mixing of human and animal eggs, but only for the purpose of testing the fertility of human sperm, said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named in line with policy. The practice was known as the \"hamster test\" because hamster eggs were used.    The revised bill now allows hybrid embryos for further research but specifies they may not be placed in a woman or an animal, the spokeswoman said. Also, those using the embryos must prove that the use is for research, and that use of an embryo is necessary, she said.    Creating hybrid embryos is not the only way to develop useful stem cells, said Minger. A new method called pluripotency, developed in December, allows scientists to turn adult cells into something resembling an embryonic stem cell, he said.    Pluripotency, however, requires extensive genetic manipulation of the cells and yields few that are of use to research, Minger said.    \"We will pursue that (research) but it's just too early to know which is the best approach,\" Minger said. \"Most rational scientists would say we need to proceed down as many tracks as possible because we just have no idea what's going to lead to the best benefit.\"    CNN's Phil Black contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/004e6e14b9498ae85e92cbb81adf76ac8b21f472.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many positions have similarities: necessary command, some disrespect?", "id": "108704", "answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 638}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- No play can begin in a baseball game until the pitcher throws the ball. And no play can conclude until the umpire makes the call.      \"We're not just robots they send out there,\" umpire Tim McClelland (2nd from L) told author Bruce Weber.      Yet these figures -- the man on the mound and the men who stand in judgment -- are vastly different in importance to the average fan.      There are countless children who dream of becoming a major-league pitcher. He is, literally, the king of the hill.      Umpires? Almost nobody dreams of becoming an umpire.      And yet the positions share a number of similarities, according to two new books: \"As They See 'Em\" (Scribner), by New York Times writer Bruce Weber, and \"The Complete Game\" (Knopf), by former major-league pitcher (and current New York Mets broadcaster) Ron Darling.      Both jobs require a great deal of command, neither gets enough training, and both are often disrespected by others in the game.      Indeed, despite a library of books by and about pitchers (Jim Bouton's \"Ball Four,\" Jim Brosnan's \"The Long Season,\" Christy Mathewson's \"Pitching in a Pinch\"), Darling said he believes that people still don't understand what it takes to stand on that mound.      \"Within baseball circles there is a common baseball axiom, 'If pitchers weren't so stupid, hitters would never get a hit,' \" he said in an e-mail. \"Of course, I knew this was a fallacy so I decided to write about the travails of major league pitchers. Throwing a ball 95 mph to tin cup-sized quadrants sounds pretty difficult to me, and I wanted to express this to the reader.\"      Umpires, on the other hand, rarely get written about at all -- in fact, they're often treated as less than human. (\"The owners basically see them like bases,\" former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent told Weber. \"They say, 'We need a base; we need an umpire; same thing.' \") Weber found a fraternity (and they are almost all men) much like cops or soldiers: tight-lipped believers in baseball law and order.      Weber immersed himself in the \"land of umpires,\" as the book's subtitle calls it, attending umpiring school, calling games at various levels of pro ball and talking with those who were willing -- including the legendary Doug Harvey, who was called \"God\" for his imperious demeanor. What he found is that what looks so obvious on television at home is often a challenge on the field, a matter not just of eyesight but positioning, rule-book knowledge and basic guts.      \"That's really what [being an umpire] is about -- is being in charge,\" he said. \"If there's anything that characterizes the major league umpire, it's that special kind of chutzpah.\"      Umpires need that presence because they're often baseball's most disrespected men. Aside from the vitriol they face -- the managers kicking dirt, the spectators yelling \"Kill the ump\" -- they're second-guessed by broadcasters and barely tolerated by management, as Weber reveals in detailing the episodes preceding and following the 1999 umpires' strike.      And yet Major League Baseball doesn't participate in umpire training or development, entrusting it to two umpire-run private schools, Weber observes. (MLB does run an annual umpire camp.)      Darling echoes Weber's concerns in his own field, pitching. In these days of strict pitch counts and injury concern, pitchers are \"undertrain[ed],\" he says, noting that top draft choices climb the ranks \"never allowed to throw more than 110 pitches.\" That leaves them at a disadvantage when they have to go deeper into a game or cope with a tough inning, he says.      \"It would be like training for the marathon and never running more than 5 miles,\" he says. \"Identifying and preserving million-dollar arms are [the purview] of doctors, not baseball people.\"      Darling's book is a chronicle of pitchers' thought processes, using individual innings from his pitching or broadcasting career to make his point. He talks about panic overtaking a pitcher, as it did for Darling in a 1984 game in which he got pasted by the Cubs; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a World Series game and -- in a treat for baseball fans -- goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever, a 1981 extra-inning contest that Darling's Yale Bulldogs lost to Frank Viola's St. John's Redmen, 1-0.      He says he remembered the games vividly. \"I definitely watched tapes and read box scores, but I was very clear on almost all the minutiae of the good old days. A little scary and maybe a major personality flaw!\"      Pitchers get more support than umpires, of course. Darling observes that the relationship between a pitcher and his catcher during a well-pitched game \"is one of sport's most beautiful dances. I would not have said it when I was playing, but after a shutout ... there is a love for that person immediately after the process. You did something together that could not have been done alone, and nobody can understand what you went through to get there.\"      Umpires, too, take pride in their best moments, though few pay attention outside their fellow umpires. More common is to be vilified for missed calls. Weber devotes a moving passage in his book to a conversation with the retired Don Denkinger, a 29-year veteran remembered by fans (if he's remembered at all) for a wrong call in the 1985 World Series.      Though time has dulled the pain, \"I think he lives with [that call] every day,\" Weber said. \"When a dreadful thing happens to you in front of so many people and you become famous for it, it must be devastating.\"      Weber says his time with umpires has made him much more sympathetic to their judgmental tasks. When watching games now, the Yankees fan says, he'll focus on the umpires.      \"I just think umpiring is interesting. People hate 'em, and they somehow perceive of umpiring as a flaw in the game, but I don't,\" he said. \"Now I'm always interested who the umpires are.\"      Which is a point the umpires would appreciate.      \"Umpires are people, too,\" veteran ump Tim McClelland told Weber. \"We have families; we have emotions. ... Somebody says, 'Kill the umpire,' and people go, 'Heh, heh, that's funny,' but in order to do that, you have to disassociate the umpire from the person.      \"We're human. We're not just robots they send out there.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/8187a762d268f60eb1a0b78ee5241869b69fc163.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who had been living in makeshift tents?", "id": "108706", "answers": [{"text": "illegal migrants", "answer_start": 116}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "CALAIS, France (CNN) -- French authorities on Tuesday dismantled a makeshift camp dubbed \"the Jungle,\" which housed illegal migrants fleeing dangerous homelands to seek a more prosperous life in Europe.    After being forced from their makeshift home, occupants of \"the Jungle\" were driven away in buses for processing.    French police broke up protests by refugee rights advocates and began clearing the squalid camp. The French government said it was targeting human smuggling and did not say where the migrants would be relocated.    Police arrested 276 migrants, 125 of whom were minors, said Calais prefecture official Catherine Mande.  See photos of police clearing the camp \u00bb    A statement from the French immigration minister's office said the \"illegal encampments\" would be destroyed and then three bulldozers, a dozen trucks and a logging company would return the land to its natural state.  Watch a report on the camp's closure \u00bb    The statement said the goal was to destroy the Jungle and other migrant shanties, \"which have become the main launch pad for clandestine immigration into the United Kingdom.\"    Was the French government right to demolish the illegal migrant camp?    Aided by smugglers, many of the migrants in coastal northern France attempt to make it into Britain, hiding in trucks that cross the English Channel. France and Britain signed an agreement in July to crack down on illegal immigration, including dispersing the migrants at the Jungle.    British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he was \"delighted\" to hear that France was honoring the agreement.    \"The measures that we have put in place are not only there to prevent illegal immigration but also to stop people trafficking,\" he said. \"We are working with the French not only to strengthen our shared border but that of Europe as a whole.\"    Johnson said both nations were committed \"to helping individuals who are genuine refugees.\" Others who don't need protection were expected to return home, he said.    The Jungle -- shanties cobbled from cardboard, plastic tarpaulins and scraps of wood -- housed as many as 1,000 men from nations such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Somalia.    Camp resident Mohammed Bashir escaped the Taliban in Afghanistan and made a new home in a tent here, among the heaps of garbage, sand and bramble on the outskirts of the French port city of Calais. Sometimes, eight men shared the tent.    \"I never lived in such a condition like this back home, but right now we don't have any other choice,\" said Bashir, 24, who left behind his family. \"It's very difficult, very hard for a person who has children and parents.\"    Desperation filled the air in the Jungle.    Many residents survived arduous and illegal treks from their homelands. Some held ambitions to keep going another 20 miles, across the water to Britain. Others hoped to realize refugee status in France.  See a map of the region \u00bb    But Tuesday, they were forced to put their plans on hold as they were evicted from the Jungle.    Refugee advocates circled the migrants and scuffled with police to keep them at bay. But eventually, the protests were broken up, the migrants were taken away and the shanties started coming down.    The French government's decision drew criticism from humanitarian workers who don't think that demolishing the camp will help resolve illegal immigration issues.    They say moving the migrants is simply displacing the problem.    \"We don't know where they're going to go,\" said Matthieu Tardis, an advocate for asylum seekers. \"We don't know what the government plans to do. We are not respecting human rights here, for sure.\"    The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees sent staff to Calais earlier in the summer to counsel people about asylum procedures in France and Britain.    According to the U.N. agency, most of the illegal migrants enter Europe through Greece and often fall victim to smugglers who turn a profit by helping migrants reach their destinations.    The camp residents who fled Afghanistan told CNN they had paid smugglers large sums. They were promised much more than the filthy camp, they said.

Tom Williams spitting fake blood from his mouth in a match between Harlequins and Leinster.    The 46-year-old was hit with disciplinary action after a hearing by an independent European Rugby Cup (ERC) panel found he had \"organized the fabrication of a blood injury\" on wing Tom Williams during a European Cup quarterfinal match against Leinster.    With his side trailing by one point Williams, under instructions from Richards, faked a cut in his mouth with a capsule of fake blood, thereby allowing goal-kicker Nick Evans to return to the field of play.    The plan may have worked if Williams had not winked to the oncoming player as he left the pitch, an action that infuriated their opponents Leinster.    The ERC confirmed in a statement on their official Web site that Richards had acknowledged his role as the orchestrator of the plan that has since been dubbed \"bloodgate,\" and the subsequent cover up of the injury.

Further evidence came to light in an appeal made by Williams before an admission of guilt by Dean Richards, who recently resigned from his position with Harlequins, prompted the ban.    The ERC appeal committee chairman Rod McKenzie said details of four other incidents of Harlequins faking injuries had been passed to the relevant authorities.    Williams's ban was reduced to four months and the fine imposed on Harlequins has been increased from $340,000 to $425,000 -- the club still awaits to hear whether they will be expelled from this season's European Cup.    The physiotherapist for the London-based club, Steph Brennan, has also been banned for two-years.    Richards had not decided whether to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but reacted to his ban by telling reporters: \"I'm surprised. Three years is a long time but I'll reflect on it overnight.    \"I took full responsibility for it. It was a farcical situation, it really was. It didn't pan out particularly well on the day.

There's no better time to do it than engagement season, which, lucky for you, is now! Get inspired by these uber-romantic celebrity proposals.    Brandon Routh popped the question to Courtney Ford while on a picnic.    Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict    Although the set of a slasher movie seems an unlikely place for romance to bloom, that's just where it happened for actors Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict. Shortly after shooting began in 1999 on their film \"Hollywood Horror,\" the co-stars started spending time together.    Seven years later, on Christmas Day 2006, Hardrict, 32, told Mowry, 30, that he wanted to give her a promise ring. Then, as her entire family looked on, the \"Lincoln Heights\" actor yelled, \"Psych!\" and got down on one knee to present her with a 1.5-carat diamond engagement ring.    Antonio Pierce and Jocelyn Maldonado    Antonio Pierce, an NFL linebacker, met Jocelyn Maldonado during a celebrity appearance at an ESPN Fantasy Football Draft. Maldonado, a model at the event, instantly caught his eye. Pierce and Maldonado (who now hosts Mets Weekly) were inseparable over the next six months.    In February 2007, Pierce treated Maldonado to a helicopter ride above Manhattan, New York, before dining at Brooklyn's The River Caf\u00e9. Famous for its chocolate Brooklyn Bridge cake, Pierce conspired with the restaurant's manager to place the engagement ring atop the confection, which was covered with pink rose petals.    Howie Dorough and Leigh Boniello    Backstreet Boy Howard \"Howie\" Dorough got more than he bargained for after hiring Leigh Boniello to be the band's webmaster in December 2000. Boniello went on tour with the group and quickly grew close to Dorough.    Six years later, the couple attended a New Year's Eve party at the New Jersey home of Boniello's father. \"I figured, what better timing,\" says Dorough, \"because all of her family was going to be there, including her 92-year-old grandmother.\"    Just before the stroke of midnight, Dorough made a toast and presented Boniello with a custom-designed three-stone diamond engagement ring.    Brandon Routh and Courtney Ford    Three years before actor Brandon Routh donned those famous blue tights, he tended bar at Lucky Strike Lanes in Hollywood. During a party there in 2003, actress Courtney Ford repeatedly poured out the drinks he made her as a ruse to chat him up. \"I kept asking him for another drink, telling him the one before was too strong,\" she recalls.    In 2006, Routh purchased the 3-carat diamond ring that had caught Ford's eye during an earlier visit to Neil Lane. But since the two were traveling for the Superman Returns press tour, Routh asked Gilbert Adler, one of the film's producers, to hold the ring until they arrived in England. \"Poor man!\" says Routh. \"He carried it around for two and a half weeks.\" Finally, while picnicking in Glastonbury, Routh popped the question.    Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter    Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter became friends after meeting at a party in 2006 and Sanchez immediately pegged him as perfect husband material. She found out for certain that he felt the same way just two days before Christmas 2007, under a full moon at midnight, in a bay off the coast of the Puerto Rican island Vieques.    The two were seated in a double kayak, taking in the bioluminescent organisms shimmering in the water all alone, except for a tour guide in a second kayak. The scene should have been pure bliss, except that Sachez was concerned when their guide speedily paddled away.    \"The guy knew to take off so Eric could propose, but imagine how I felt floating in this huge bay in the middle of the night with nobody around,\" Sanchez explains. \"I started calling back, 'Senor, hello! Come back!' until I realized something was going on.\"    After an \"amazing speech,\" Winter pulled out a 4.3-carat brilliant-cut diamond ring by Michael Barin, Sanchez's favorite jeweler. But her joy was soon laced with anxiety over the fact that such a costly bauble was surrounded by acres of sea. \"I said, 'Put it away, please. I don't want it to drop in the water!'\"    Anna Chlumsky and Shaun So    Actress Anna Chlumsky, 27, best known for her role in \"My Girl,\" was awaiting her seven-year anniversary with college sweetheart and army reservist Shaun So, 28, and hoping he might pop the question.    While they were having breakfast at a caf\u00e9 in her neighborhood a week before their anniversary, Chlumsky described a cocktail ring a friend was selling. So, who had been carrying an engagement ring for two weeks in anticipation of the perfect moment, pulled out the 1-carat, cathedral-mounted, radiant-cut bauble and asked, \"Does it look anything like this?\"    Guiliana DePandi & Bill Rancic    It started out all business: Giuliana DePandi was interviewing Bill Rancic, first-season winner on \"The Apprentice\" and co-host of the Chicago, Illinois, TV show \"In the Loop with iVillage.\" But when the cameras stopped rolling in April 2006, a whirlwind -- and adventurous -- romance began.    Eight months later, when Rancic, 36, popped the question during a chopper flight over Chicago, complete with champagne, Giordano's deep-dish pizza (DePandi's favorite) and Michael Bubl\u00e9 tunes piped into the headset.    \"Bill told me we were going to look at Christmas lights,\" says DePandi. \"It was dark in the helicopter, so I didn't really get a look at the ring until the next day, when I went into shock for the second time,\" she says of the 4-carat cushion-cut diamond in a micro pav\u00e9 setting Rancic helped design.    Jeri Ryan and Chistophe Eme    \"He was hot!\" Shark star Jeri Ryan, 39, recalls of first glimpsing her future husband, Christophe Em\u00e9, 38, at a food-related charity event four years ago. \"He looked good in his chef's hat, and he had this ornery little spark in his eye that I really enjoy.\" After dating for two years, the couple opened Ortolan, their celebrated French restaurant in Los Angeles, California.    The proposal came soon after. \"One night, Christophe covered my eyes and took me into our bedroom,\" recalls Ryan. There the die-hard romantic had placed candles, champagne and a canvas painted with the messages \"And you come with me forever\" in French and \"Grow old along with me\" in English. Em\u00e9 then presented Ryan with a made-to-order cushion-cut solitaire set in pav\u00e9 diamonds.    Jason Priestley and Naomi Lowde    Fate has looked after Jason Priestley. On Valentine's Day 2000 the actor met Naomi Lowde, a makeup artist from Hertfordshire, England, while walking back from a play rehearsal in London. \"I was smitten,\" says Priestley, now 36.    The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum and Lowde, 27, immediately began dating, and in 2002 they moved back to California together. That's when fate took another turn: On August 11, 2002, Priestley was driving his race car on a Kentucky track when he hit a wall at 180 mph. Though he sustained three skull fractures, a broken back and a bleeding artery in his neck, he pulled through.    \"It was a tough time, but it was also magical because we kept each other's spirits high,\" says Lowde. \"We pushed two beds together in the hospital and put Swifty, our French bulldog, in the middle. We were together 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for three months.\"    In May 2004 Priestley arranged another trip to London, England -- to the very street corner where he and Naomi first met, where he presented her with an emerald-cut, three-diamond ring by Steven Pomerantz.    Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell    What happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas -- and for Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell, that's not a bad thing. Nearly four years ago the two ran into each other poolside at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. \"I was working on a documentary, and Jerry offered to help,\" recalls Romijn, 35. \"He spent a week operating the microphone, but later he told me he would have done anything. I don't think he really cared about the project, if you know what I mean.\"    For their first date the couple went to see the Blue Man Group with friends, and O'Connell had Romijn in stitches. \"It was this whole Jerry show in my ear. That's how it is with Jerry. You get sucked into it!\" Evidently: A year and a half later, on September 18, 2005, O'Connell, 33, proposed to Romijn in New York with a diamond ring from Simon G.    \"I got down on one knee, asked her to marry me and said, 'You better say yes' a couple of times -- there was a little bit of a pause on her part,\" says O'Connell.

But the judge did not send Lafave to jail, saying the violation was \"not willful and substantial.\"  \"Please don't come back,\" he scolded.

Lafave, 27, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation.  Lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors. A tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court, prompting the prosecutor to observe, \"I think she's accounted for.\"  Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation. She referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just \"girl talk.\"  Lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers. \"I don't speak that way about my personal life,\" she said. But she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a \"small group setting.\"  While other co-workers socialized outside work, Lafave said, the 17-year-old was not included in those outings.  Asked why she hugged the young co-worker, Lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family. The contact came, she said, \"out of my good nature, that's the way it worked.\"  The contacts that led to Thursday's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of Lafave's court-ordered supervision.  She received a verbal reprimand a year ago, according to testimony. When the behavior continued, her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation.  She was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother's beauty shop.  In the past, Lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment.

President Obama, here with Hillary Clinton on Friday, calls the situation in Afghanistan \"increasingly perilous.\"  Obama on Friday announced his plan to tackle what he called an \"international security challenge of the highest order.\"  Stressing soberly that \"the safety of people around the world is at stake,\" Obama said the \"situation is increasingly perilous\" in the region in and around Afghanistan, where the United States has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban for more than 7\u00bd years after attacks in New York and at the Pentagon.  \"The United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11, 2001, for doing nothing more than going about their daily lives,\" said Obama, who has vowed to make Afghanistan the central front in the fight against terrorism.  \"So let me be clear: Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the U.S. homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan.  Watch how the U.S. will target terrorist safe havens \u00bb  \"And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.\"  Obama said it is key Americans understand that Pakistan \"needs our help\" against al Qaeda.  \"Al Qaeda and other violent extremists have killed several thousand Pakistanis since 9/11. They have killed many Pakistani soldiers and police. They assassinated [former Pakistani Prime Minister] Benazir Bhutto. They have blown up buildings, derailed foreign investment and threatened the stability of the state. Make no mistake: Al Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within.\"  Watch Obama's speech on Afghanistan, Pakistan threats \u00bb  Flanked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Obama called on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Richard Lugar, R-Indiana.  The legislation authorizes \"$1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools, roads and hospitals and strengthen Pakistan's democracy,\" he said.  He also urged Congress to pass legislation that would create opportunity zones in the border region. The goal is to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued by violence. Obama said, \"We will ask our friends and allies to do their part,\" including at a donors conference next month in Tokyo, Japan.  \"After years of mixed results, we will not provide a blank check. Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders. And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets. \"  Obama said the United States must work with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and others to help Pakistan get through the economic crisis.  \"To lessen tensions between two nuclear-armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation, we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both India and Pakistan.\"  Afghan President Harmid Karzai watched the speech on CNN from Kabul, said Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Karzai \"is extremely grateful and will issue his statement of support,\" Holbrooke said.  Obama stressed that \"Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq\" and now a commitment must be made.  Obama said he is sending another 4,000 troops to Afghanistan, along with hundreds of civilian specialists, such as agricultural experts, educators and engineers. The troops -- which are in addition to the 17,000 announced earlier -- will be charged with training and building the Afghan army and police force.  The stakes are high as al Qaeda and the Taliban have escalated the insurgency and the number of U.S. troops deaths spiked last year -- the highest yearly death toll for them in the war.  Obama said the soldiers and Marines \"will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east\" and will work with Afghan troops along the border. He said such an effort will bolster \"security in advance of the important presidential election in August.\"  Watch Obama tell terrorists U.S. will defeat them \u00bb  Obama said the coalition \"will accelerate\" efforts to \"build an Afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011 -- and increases in Afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the Afghans go forward.\"  He said Afghanistan's government has been \"undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people\" and its economy is undercut by \"a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency.\"  Watch Obama's remarks on the Afghan situation \u00bb  Obama said the United States will set clear benchmarks for international assistance and won't ignore attention to corruption.  He said the United States will develop a new contact group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that would include not only NATO allies and other partners but also Central Asian states, Gulf nations and Iran, Russia, India and China.  Reacting to Obama's plan, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wisconsin, said he is pleased the president is focusing on al Qaeda and is addressing the role of Pakistan but expressed concern the strategy could remain \"overly Afghan-centric.\"  Citing Friday's suicide attack on a mosque in the Pakistani tribal region near Afghanistan, Feingold said, \"This new administration must ensure that we do what we must not only in Afghanistan but also in Pakistan.\"  He said, \"As the bombing near the Khyber Pass this morning highlights, we need to fully address the inextricable links between the crisis in Afghanistan and the instability and terrorist threats in Pakistan.\"  The bombing killed at least 48 people and wounded 80 to 90 others.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Obama's plan, saying it is \"a significant pivot\" away from the Democratic Party's left wing.  \"So the president's decision to continue Secretary Gates, follow [U.S. Central Command chief] Gen.

Understandably that raises concern about a soaring world population. But there is a good news story from the demographic data that is not often told. We -- or rather the poor women of the world -- are defusing the population bomb.      Women today are having half as many children as their mothers and grandmothers. The global average is now down to 2.5 children per woman, and it continues to fall.      This is not just a rich-world phenomenon. Much of Asia now has fertility rates below two, from Japan and Korea to China, with its one-child policy, through Taiwan, Vietnam, Burma, Singapore and much of southern India and parts of the Middle East. Behind the veil, the women of Iran have cut their fertility from eight to less than two in a generation.      The young people out on the streets demanding democracy during the Arab Spring are arguably far more politically active because they are not at home raising large families.      Falling fertility happens faster if countries get richer and if women are better educated. Similarly urbanization helps a lot. While even young children can be an economic asset on an African peasant farm, they are an economic liability in cities, where they require education before they can get a job. The teeming megacities of the poor world may look like symbols of overpopulation, but they are part of the solution, too.      But the real story is that rich or poor, Muslim or Catholic, secular or devout, socialist or capitalist, with tough government birth control policies or none, most countries tell the same story. Small families are becoming the new norm.      The reason, I believe, is very simple. Women are having smaller families because for the first time in history they can. In the 20th century, the world largely eradicated the diseases that used to kill off most children. Today, most kids get to grow up. Mothers no longer need to have five or six children to ensure the next generation. Two or three is enough, and that is what they are choosing to have.      There are holdouts, of course. In much of Africa, rural women still typically have five children or more. But if Africa follows Asia, then we can see an end to population growth. We are, I believe, likely to see \"peak population\" by about mid-century. Perhaps at around 9 billion people.      After that, on current trends of fertility falling to below replacement levels, we will see a falling world population.      And rapid aging. With longer life expectancy and fewer babies, this is all but inevitable. China will soon be aging faster than anywhere on Earth. Aging is set to be the dominant demographic phenomenon of the 21st century, just as the population boom dominated the 20th century.      What does this mean for the environment? Well, peak population is good news, of course. But don't hang the flags. It is a pervasive myth that it is all those extra people that are wrecking the planet. That's no longer the case.      Rising consumption today is a far bigger threat to the environment than a rising head-count. And most of that extra consumption is still happening in rich countries that have long since given up growing their populations.      According to Stephen Pacala, the director of the Princeton Environmental Institute, the world's richest half billion people -- that's about 7 % of the global population -- are responsible for half the world's carbon dioxide emissions, the primary cause of man-made climate change. Meanwhile the poorest 50 % of the world are responsible for just 7 % of emissions. So there is no way halting population growth in the poor world today would have more than a very marginal effect on climate change.      It is the world's consumption patterns we need to fix, not its reproductive habits. Every time we talk about too many babies in Africa or India, we are denying this fact.      The population bomb may be being defused by the women of the poor world. But the rich world has not even begun to defuse the consumption bomb.

The government is seeking to buy 166 acres in western Pennsylvania to complete the area needed to build a memorial on 2,200 acres.    \"The (National Park Service) will negotiate with the landowners to reach agreement. If agreement is not reached, eminent domain remains as a backstop to acquire these lands,\" said Kendra Barkoff, spokeswoman for the Department of Interior.

A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday also indicates the vast majority of Americans believe that full-body scanners should be used in airports across the country.      Nearly two-thirds of people questioned in the poll said they have a moderate or great deal of confidence in the administration to protect the public from future terrorist attacks, up 2 percentage points from August. Thirty-five percent said they have not much or no confidence, down 1 percentage point from August.      Read the full poll results (PDF)      A number of Republicans have criticized President Obama over his handling of the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan. But according to the survey, 57 percent approve of the way Obama has responded, while 39 percent disapprove of how he handled the situation.      \"Only a third of Republicans have a positive view of Obama on this matter, but the key for the administration is the 55 percent of independents who approve of how the president responded to the incident on Christmas Day,\" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director.      The poll also indicates no increase in overall concern about terrorism.      \"In October, about a third said they were worried that a family member would become a victim of terrorism, and that number is unchanged in the wake of the attempted attack in December,\" Holland said.      \"The public seems to react calmly to individual incidents, possibly because most Americans believe that the government cannot prevent every single terrorist plot from occurring.\"      Six in 10 said terrorists always will find a way to launch an attack, no matter what the government does, he added -- identical to the number who felt that way during the Bush administration.      The poll indicates a majority, 57 percent, think suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab should be tried in military court and not a civilian criminal court. Forty-two percent back handling the case in civilian court.      According to the survey, Americans also are split on whether heads should roll as a result of the attempted bombing of the airliner. Forty-six percent questioned feel that top officials in the federal agencies responsible for handling the issue of terrorism should be fired, while 51 percent said no.      The poll indicates that nearly eight in 10 believe full-body scanners should be used in U.S. airports, while 15 percent said they would refuse to go through one of the machines if asked to do so.      \"Most Americans don't see full-body scanners as a health risk, and more than seven in 10 say they would be unconcerned if asked to go through one at an airport,\" Holland said.      \"Women in particular seem to prefer the idea of a full-body scanner to being frisked by a security guard, even when the question makes clear that the guard doing the manual pat-down would also be a woman.\"      The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, with 1,021 adult Americans questioned by telephone.

A mother and child in the recovery room of Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.      The stream of patients arriving at the free clinic run by international aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres is virtually uninterrupted. Some arrive in police ambulance or via the Haitian Red Cross; others are dropped off in wheelbarrows, according to Brian Phillip Moller, head of the 60-bed trauma center.      Gunfire no longer fills the nights the way it did when he was last in Haiti in 2006, but the workload for aid workers hasn't diminished. Instead hospitals like Trinite are dealing with trauma cases the public health system is incapable of handling, Moller tells CNN.      While the security situation in Haiti has improved during the last two years, the public health system remains in disarray, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders.      The organization, which offers free care at three clinics in Port-au-Prince, says basic health services are practically non-existent in the capital city, the result of a public health system marred by mismanagement, strikes and shortages of medical personnel and supplies.      \"The Haitian system is at breakpoint,\" says Moller. The private health care sector has developed in recent years, but most in poverty-stricken Haiti cannot afford to pay the fees charged for services.      MSF is urging the international community to increase pressure on Haiti to improve its health system. The call comes as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Haiti's Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis and representatives of donor countries are set to meet in Washington Tuesday to discuss international assistance for the country.      With the public health system underfunded and understaffed, patients often have nowhere to turn but to free clinics. An obstetrics hospital run by MSF in Port-au-Prince manages 40 percent of the childbirth-related emergencies among poor women in the city.      At Trinite, doctors treated nearly 18,000 trauma cases last year. The hospital's bed occupation rates are at 100 percent and at times staff have no choice but to refer patients to public health facilities that they know are inadequate.  See photos of the health crisis in Haiti \u00bb      MSF France, which runs the Trinite trauma center, plans to withdraw from Port-au-Prince next year, which could make the situation for Haiti's poorest even more dire.      Urban conflict has subsided, reducing the need for a war surgery hospital, Moller says. About one-third of the cases at the hospital are related to road vehicle accidents. The group's mission is to provide urgent care to crisis-hit areas, he says, not cope with everyday trauma.      Although the security crisis has abated, violence, is still very much a part of life in Haiti's capital city and poses a major health care challenge. One in five cases admitted to the Trinite are violence related.      \"Access to adequate health care is a basic human right and it is definitely not being met here in Haiti. The issue needs to be addressed very quickly. People are dying needlessly and will continue to unless this issue is addressed,\" Moller says."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a42b94cf39d3166523c53788327430725f33d544.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who described woman who spoke to him as bigoted?", "id": "108736", "answers": [{"text": "Prime Minister Gordon Brown", "answer_start": 28}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "London, England (CNN) -- UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described himself as a \"penitent sinner\" on Wednesday after personally apologizing to a voter he described as a \"bigoted woman.\"      Brown visited the home of Gillian Duffy in Rochdale, northwestern England, after he was caught on microphone describing in blunt terms his encounter with the 65-year-old widow whom he met on the election campaign trail.

A guard watches over a pile of burning drugs in Kabul, Afghanistan, on June 25, 2008.    Khan Mohammed, 38, of Nangarhar Province became the first person convicted and sentenced in the United States under a 2006 law that increased the penalty for a defendant found to be involved  with terrorism and distributing illegal drugs.    Mohammed, who had been extradited from Afghanistan, was convicted by a jury in May of plotting a rocket attack on U.S. military forces and Afghan civilians at Jalalabad Airfield.    He also was found guilty of distributing between $1 million and $3 million worth of heroin into the United States \"to kill Americans as part of a jihad.\"    Mohammed's court-appointed lawyer, conceding that \"what he did was wrong,\" urged U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to be lenient and sentence his client to only 20 years in prison.    Then the full-bearded Mohammed, dressed in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit, addressed the judge. With tears streaming down his face, and choking back his words, he begged for only one or two years.    \"I have little children and a woman. They depend on me,\" Mohammed began. \"I'm so worried about them.\" His lengthy emotional appeal went on to include his reason for selling opium.    \"In my village that's how you have to make a living. There is no house there without opium,\" he said.    Justice Department prosecutor Matthew Stiglitz, however, urged the court to \"send a message of deterrence,\" and warned against \"the confluence of drug trafficking and terrorism.\"    \"No, he's not the Osama bin Laden of terrorism. No, he's not the Pablo Escobar of the drug world,\" Stiglitz told the judge. \"But this is where the rubber meets the road.\"    Bin Laden is the head of al Qaeda, while Escobar, who died in 1993, was the most powerful of Colombian drug lords.    \"Afghanistan is ground zero for opium, and an almost limitless source of funds to the Taliban,\" he argued.    Kollar-Kotelly agreed fully with the prosecutors, and strongly admonished the Taliban defendant.    \"You were convicted 99 percent by your own words,\" the judge declared, as she recalled how a \"courageous\" Afghan police chief wore an undercover wire to record Mohammed's plotting.    \"The fact that no one died is only because you didn't get the missiles you wanted,\" she said.    \"In 2006, you celebrated the Americans' use of the opium. It was a jihad. You knew the damage it could cause,\" the judge continued. \"Because of your undiluted hatred for the United States, you might well have launched other attacks had you not been arrested.\"    She added, \"Terrorists stand unique among criminals. Deterrence is very important here.\"    Then, concluding dramatically, the judge turned directly to the defendant.    \"I heard your concerns for your family but no acceptance of responsibility for your action,\" the judge said. \"Defendants often express worry for their families, but if they considered the consequences of their actions beforehand, maybe they would have acted differently.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/e89ab1af2837018e1e25679b22ed2514ad00952c.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many vessels were attacked?", "id": "108740", "answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 386}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- Pirates captured a Belgian ship and said they were taking it to the coast of Somalia after the vessel was reported missing early Saturday, NATO and pirate sources told CNN.

The Dutch frigate De Zeven Provincien was with the NATO fleet patrolling the region.

Americans traveling to sites around the world like the Blue Mosque in Istanbul should be respectful.    In their youthful, loud exuberance, they ended up ripping each other's shirts as they horsed around.    \"I thought to myself that those shirts probably cost maybe 20, 30, 40 dollars apiece, and here you are in a culture where the people may not be even making that much on a monthly basis.    \"It's that sort of thing, just not being aware how off-putting that can be to the local culture.\"    Such behavior, while seemingly harmless, can help to cement the moniker of \"the ugly American,\" which came to refer to loud, rude and thoughtless behavior of U.S. citizens abroad.    The term came about as a result of the book \"The Ugly American,\" and more than 50 years after its publication, those from the United States continue to battle an image of arrogance and nationalism.    Written by William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick, the novel chronicled American foreign policy and diplomacy failures in a fictitious developing nation. In the book, the American ambassador to the country is portrayed as crude and inept.    That enduring legacy has not been easy to shake, and even the U.S. president knows the score.    During a recent trek to Turkey, President Obama said in his remarks at the Tophane Cultural Center in Istanbul that he knows the \"stereotypes of the United States are out there.\"    \"Sometimes it suggests that America has become selfish and crass, or that we don't care about the world beyond us,\" he said. \"And I'm here to tell you that that's not the country that I know and it's not the country that I love.\"    Whitman, the author of the \"Wanderlust and Lipstick\" guides and publisher of \"Traveling with Kids,\" often gives lectures and workshops -- many geared toward female travelers -- and speaks on the importance of Americans being stellar representatives of their homeland while abroad.    \"It's about being respectful of the country and the culture, treating the people respectfully and not flashing around your money and your material possessions,\" Whitman said. \"It's up to every individual to be that ambassador and portray their country well.\"    Author Ann Hulbert wrote a piece for The New York Times Magazine a few years ago about her desire not to be mistaken for an ugly American when her family traveled to Istanbul and the Turkish coast.    Hulbert took the step of vetoing one of her teenage son's T-shirts, worried that the message on it, \"The Fighting Quakers. Beat them 'til they reach consensus,\" might be misunderstood in the Muslim country.    \"I think that when you are a big and powerful country, it's easy for the rest of the world to feel that you don't deal with the kind of consideration and humility that other people do,\" said Hulbert, who researches the areas she visits prior to her trips. iReport.com: Ever been to the Netherlands? Share your travel pics    Christopher P. Baker, who is a Cuba travel expert and award-winning author of the best-selling guidebook \"Moon Cuba,\" said he has concerns about what will happen if and when travel restrictions are completely lifted from that country.    He recalled two years ago when he was reviewing one of Havana's first five-star hotels that had just opened. Standing in the lobby with one of the hotel's executives, he witnessed a man, dripping wet from the pool and wrapped in a towel, emerge from the elevator.    The man walked through the bar, down the stairs and into the marble lobby just as the staff tried to intercept him, Baker said.    \"I heard them say, 'We don't allow guests in the lobby dressed this way,' and the man said, 'Yeah, I know' in this deep American brogue,\" Baker said. \"Behavior like that is not necessarily common to Americans, but it's the type of thing that can give Americans a bad name.\"    Manners and lifestyle expert Thomas P. Farley runs the site What Manners Most and said Americans tend to be seen as free-spirited and not nearly as guarded as natives of some of the other countries -- as evidenced most recently by first lady Michelle Obama putting her arm around Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.    \"That's something that maybe sent shivers up the spine of a lot Britons, but in the final analysis, people really looked at that as a nice gesture and something very American to do,\" said Farley, who added that travelers should be as respectful in other countries as they would be if they were in someone else's home.    The Obamas may actually be aiding in changing the perception themselves.    Travel writer Beth Whitman said the mere election of President Obama has helped to improve America's reputation worldwide.    \"It helped to change how we are viewed, but the real key is the behavior once a person arrives in a country,\" Whitman said. \"Some of [the ugly American perception] will exist no matter who is in office, and that's why everyone has to take responsibility for being the very best representative of their country that they can.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/a6011a0db0b375ee2df976f9513e89e3676bd818.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How much is Cuba slashing imports by?", "id": "108742", "answers": [{"text": "of U.S. food", "answer_start": 1520}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Richard Waltzer has a pitch for Cuba: Miller beer and H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream.

Restarting the Large Hadron Collider -- the $10 billion research tool's full name -- has been \"a herculean effort,\" CERN's director for accelerators, Steve Myers, said in a statement announcing the success.    Update: First collisions at the LHC on Monday    Experiments at the LHC may help answer fundamental questions such as why Albert Einstein's theory of relativity -- which describes the world on a large scale -- doesn't jibe with quantum mechanics, which deals with matter far too small to see.    Physicists established a circulating proton beam in the LHC's 17-mile tunnel at 10 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Friday, CERN said, a critical step towards getting results from the accelerator.    \"It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again,\" said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. \"We've still got some way to go before physics can begin, but with this milestone we're well on the way.\"    Located underground on the border of Switzerland and France, the LHC has been inching towards operation since the summer.    It reached its operating temperature -- 271 degrees below zero Celsius -- on October 8 and particles were injected on October 23.    Now that a beam is circulating, the next step is low-energy collisions, which should begin in about a week, CERN said. High-energy collisions will follow next year.    The collider has been dogged by problems. It made headlines early this month when a bird apparently dropped a \"bit of baguette\" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down.    The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz. Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said.    The collider achieved its first full-circle beam last year on September 10 amid much celebration.    But just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said.    The faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two-thirds of an inch by two-thirds of an inch.    \"There was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident,\" he said. Now, \"people are feeling a lot better because we know we've done so much work in the last year.\"    Mark Wise, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, said he's just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event.    Wise noted that Tevatron, the collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, has also had its share of failures but is generally considered to work just fine.    \"It's a horribly complicated piece of equipment, it's not like there's not going to be problems along the way,\" he said. \"They will surmount those problems.\"    The LHC will probably be in operation more than 20 years, Myers said.    But it won't be that long before scientists could potentially discover new properties of nature. The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called \"the God particle\" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said.    Evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a \"super partner\" with similar properties in a quantum dimension (according to some physics theories, there are hidden dimensions in the universe) -- could crop up as early as 2010.    For some theoretical physicists such as Wise, finding the Higgs boson and verifying every prediction of the Standard Model of physics would be the worst outcome. He wants the LHC to deliver surprises, even if that means no Higgs.    \"When push comes to shove, the name of the game is 'what is nature,' and we're not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us,\" Wise said.    ATLAS and CMS are the general-purpose experiments designed to find the Higgs boson and other rare particles that have never been detected before.    ALICE, another experiment, will explore the matter that existed some 10 microseconds after the Big Bang, said John Harris, professor of physics at Yale University and national coordinator of ALICE-USA.    At that time, there was a \"hot soup\" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, he said.    Although they have never been directly seen, these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons, neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it.

Some memorial tickets went out to \"friends and family\" on Sunday.    Registration ended at 6 p.m. Saturday. Officials will now \"scrub\" all entries to eliminate duplicates and those they suspect may have been registered using software that ticket scalpers use to generate multiple hits.    A random drawing will follow. The winning 8,750 registrants will receive an e-mail Sunday after 11 a.m. (2 p.m. ET), AEG Live said.    \"I know I'll be hitting the 'refresh' button on my inbox over and over again,\" said Jackie Flower, an arts student in San Diego, California.    The e-mail will assign the selected registrants a unique code and direct them to a designated distribution center away from the Staples Center.    There, they will each receive two tickets to either the memorial service at the Staples Center arena or a simulcast of the event at the adjacent Nokia Theater LA Live, AEG said.    Jackson's family has still not announced the singer's burial arrangements, saying only that it will hold a private ceremony ahead of the massive public memorial service Tuesday.    Journalists staked out several possible burial locations. A long line of television satellite trucks remained parked outside the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn Cemetery in case it was chosen by the family, but there has been no word from cemetery officials.    Police set up metal barricades around the front lawn, creating spaces for media and fans. Two state trooper cruisers idled at the Hall of Liberty inside the grounds, which contains a 1,200-seat auditorium.   Watch reporters prepare for Tuesday's service \u00bb    The family has not decided whether Jackson's body will be brought to the Staples Center arena, where the public ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. PT.    At the time of his death, Jackson was working with a concert promotions company on 50 sold-out shows in London, England, beginning in mid-July.    Also Saturday, a handful of fans milled about the Jackson family home in Encino, California, bringing flowers and taking pictures next to an informal sidewalk shrine to the pop star.    Farzana Payind of Los Angeles snapped a picture of her 6-year-old daughter, Enayah.    Payind said Enayah loves to dance to Jackson songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Thriller\" and cried when she learned of the singer's death.    \"Does that mean his music died too?\" the girl asked, according to Payind.    Neighbor Michael Singer watched the activities with interest.    \"This makes Elvis look like nothing,\" he said.    \"When you grow up with Michael Jackson's music pretty much your whole life, you feel like you lost a family member, and you have to go to the funeral,\" said Add Seymour of Atlanta, Georgia, who registered Friday morning and planned to fly out if picked.    \"I got some frequent-flier miles just in case I wanted to do something wild and crazy -- and this is wild and crazy.\"    Tickets will be handed out Monday outside the Staples Center, said Tim Leiweke, president of AEG Live. Ticketholders will also have wristbands to match their tickets, a precaution against people \"trying to take advantage\" of the system, he said.    Although 11,000 seats are available for fans inside the Staples Center, another 6,500 can watch from the Nokia Theater site across the street, according to Leiweke.    Police said they will close the area near the Staples Center to all those without a ticket.    The family will provide a free live video feed to networks so it can be televised everywhere.    \"I want to stress to those people who are coming, or are thinking about coming, to the city for this special event that you might want to consider watching this from the comfort of your home,\" said Councilwoman Jan Perry, the city's acting mayor while Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is out of the country.    The city government will provide security for the event, despite a budget crisis, Perry said.    Despite the interest surrounding the service, few details have emerged.    Ken Ehrlich, known for producing the Grammy Awards, is producing the memorial show, his company said. And Kenny Ortega, who was to have co-directed Jackson's series of concerts in London this summer, will direct it.    Singer Jennifer Hudson will be among the performers taking the stage, CNN has confirmed.    Drug rumors swirl    Meanwhile, speculation that anesthetic drugs might have played a role in the singer's death June 25 continued to swell Friday after a Los Angeles law enforcement source told The Associated Press that investigators found Diprivan, a powerful sedative, in Jackson's home.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta talk with physician who accompanied Jackson on tour \u00bb    Earlier in the week, a nutritionist, Cherilyn Lee, said Jackson pleaded for the drug despite being told of its harmful effects.    And sources close to Jackson said Thursday that the pop icon traveled with what amounted to a mini-clinic, complete with an IV pole and an anesthesiologist who medicated the insomniac singer, during his HIStory world tour in the mid-90s.    Authorities do not know what killed Jackson and await toxicology results, which are due back in two to three weeks.    \"We are treating all unnamed sources as rumors. And, as we have stated before, we will not be responding to rumors or innuendo,\" said lawyers for Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray, on Friday. \"We are awaiting the facts to come out, and we will respond at that time.\"    Los Angeles police have interviewed Murray, who apparently tried to revive the singer after he was found unconscious at his rented Holmby Hills estate.    The department said it is now working with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the state Attorney General's Office as it looks into Jackson's death.    \"For anything that has to do with drugs, the DEA are the experts on that,\" said Jim McDonnell, assistant police chief. \"And if you're looking at the prescription issues, where else would you go?\"    CNN's Susan Roesgen, Allison Blakely, Jeff King, Denise Quan, Don Lemon, Kay Jones and Drew Griffin in Los Angeles, California, and Danielle Dellorto in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9811ec35f96bd18f48346e9a3c0fbe20d7cd9834.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How many Nigerians have been died in recent violence?", "id": "108746", "answers": [{"text": "More than 400 people", "answer_start": 24}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 400 people have been killed in a spate of violence in northern Nigeria, the president of a human rights group said Tuesday.    More than 150 alleged militants were arrested by Nigerian police after clashes.    The violence has pitted Islamic militants against government police and troops in the north-central part of the nation, officials said.    Attacks continued Tuesday in the suburbs of the northern city of Maiduguri, said Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress, a human rights organization based in northern Nigeria. People there are seeking refuge in police and military barracks and in hospitals, he said.    Police and troops were dispatched to the militants' hideouts after they began attacks on government establishments Sunday, said police spokesman Moses Anegbode. As authorities exchanged fire with the militants, 41 people, including a soldier and a policeman, were killed, Anegbode said Monday. In addition, some 176 people were arrested in Bauchi, he said.    Besides Bauchi, militants also staged attacks on the nearby states of Yobe and Borno on Sunday and Monday, said Emmanuel Ojukwu, spokesman for the national police.    Yobe's police commissioner, Alhaji Muhammed Abbas, said that 23 suspected militants were arrested in connection with a bomb attack at a police station in Potiskum that killed a policeman and a civilian and wounded seven people.    The official News Agency of Nigeria reported that as many as 100 members of a religious sect led by Sheikh Mohammed Yusuf may have been killed in a confrontation with police.    In Borno, police spokesman Isa Azare said that two policemen were killed in an attack on police headquarters late Monday.    \"The religious fanatics took the police unawares,\" Azare told the government-affiliated New Nigerian newspaper. \"That was why they succeeded in killing all the officers on night duty.\"    Panicked residents stayed inside in all three states, and businesses shut down, even though officials said the situation was under control.    The militants used guns, bows and arrows and machetes in the attacks, officials said.    The militants disagree with the government's teaching of Islam in the region, maintaining that the government allows itself to be influenced by Western values, and have been attacking government offices and Islamic clergy.    There is a history of religious violence in central Nigeria, where majority-Muslim north Africa meets largely Christian sub-Saharan Africa. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001.    The human rights organization alleged last week that police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year. Most of the victims were young Muslim men, often unarmed, the group charged in testimony before a state commission examining the riots and in a separate report. More than 700 people died in the violence, the organization said, citing local religious authorities on both sides of the divide.

He said he survived again when a roadside bomb went off in Iraq killing four fellow Marines. He'd point to his head and tell people he had a metal plate, collateral damage from the explosion.    Richard Strandlof says he didn't mean to cause harm when he lied about being a military veteran.    Crowds ate up his story. He canvassed Colorado appearing at the sides of politicians. Inspiring and seemingly authentic, he spoke on behalf of veterans at the state Capitol.    It turns out the whole thing was a lie. He wasn't at the Pentagon. He was never a Marine. He never served his country. He never graduated from the Naval Academy. He claimed his name was Rick Duncan.    He formed a group called the Colorado Veterans Alliance, and the FBI is now investigating whether he embezzled money as a result.  Watch Strandlof defend himself \u00bb    Where was he on 9/11, the day he said he witnessed heroism firsthand?    \"I was in San Jose, California, watching it in horror on TV with a few other people,\" Strandlof told CNN's Anderson Cooper.    He was at a homeless shelter at the time.    Strandlof denies being a pathological liar. He says he suffered from \"some severely underdiagnosed mental illness\" and that he got caught up in the moment around \"people who are passionate and loved what they did.\"    He told CNN he had put on a \"production, which I'm sorry for.\"    \"Hopefully the people that I hurt can in some way gain closure from that, and I myself don't know what I can do short of leaving them alone and not being in their lives, to make that happen,\" Strandlof said.    He said he's not sure exactly how he's hurt people. \"It's not for me to say, and time will tell,\" he said.    Hal Bidlack, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel, is one of those people. He ran for Congress as a Democrat and had Strandlof appear with him. Bidlack isn't too happy.    \"Once one lie fell apart, the whole series of things ... just cascaded into an ocean of lies,\" he said.    Bidlack was at the Pentagon when it came under attack on September 11, 2001. He now realizes that Strandlof stole portions of his own story.    \"Now that we know he's a lying fraud,\" Bidlack said, \"I think he was just parroting my own story back to me.\"    \"There are an awful lot of things that he kept straight to try to fool an awful lot of people for an awful long time.\"    Doug Sterner has catalogued hundreds of people claiming to be military veterans who never served in the military. He says it's typical for those perpetuating the hoaxes to claim mental illness.    \"I don't buy that,\" Sterner said. \"What he was doing was looking for a cause to promote himself. I see this repeatedly. I've had a hundred cases just this year like Rick Strandlof's. ... What they're doing is building a kingdom of self and feeding their own ego.\"    Sterner has pushed for a federal database listing the names and citations of all decorated military veterans to help put an end to such cases. He said Strandlof has robbed true veterans of their veracity.    \"Doing good does not take away from the bad that he did,\" he said. \"Because of Rick Strandlof, the next global war on terrorism veteran that speaks in a school or talks to the media or gets involved in politics is going to be questioned.\"    According to the Denver Post, Strandlof came to authorities' attention first in 1997, when he was sentenced to five years on forgery and bad-check charges.    With the FBI now investigating him for fraud, he told CNN he's innocent. \"We did not take money to use on non-veterans projects. I did not enrich myself on this. I did not gain any money from this,\" he said.

Jared Polis, a Democrat, represents Colorado's 2nd Congressional District and is appearing in CNN.com's \"Freshman Year\" series along with Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah.    Jared Polis says America's immigration system is broken and urgently needs reform.    (CNN) -- Twelve-year-old Josh Garcia courageously took the stage. Fighting back tears, he told how he came home from school one day to find that his father had been taken into an immigration detention facility.    His father, an entrepreneur who had created dozens of jobs, was \"exactly the kind of person we want in this country.\" And there wasn't a dry eye in the place as this young American boy told the audience how the next time he saw his father, he was traumatized to find him \"in a prison\" surrounded by men with guns.    On June 13, I sponsored an immigration town hall in my home state of Colorado to discuss the harm our broken immigration system is causing American families and the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform.    More than 1,600 attendees, including representatives from Protestant, Catholic, Jewish and Muslim faiths, filled the Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish Center in Northglenn and spilled outside onto the lawn in the hot June sun.    Catholic Archbishop Charles Chaput -- despite our many differences -- joined me onstage to urge people of faith to stand up for immigration reform. The audience listened with rapt attention as Josh and several other Americans directly impacted by our broken immigration laws recounted their haunting tales.    Our current immigration system is broken and greatly in need of reform. In order to create real, long-lasting reform, we must create a pathway to legal status for the millions of undocumented immigrants who have made lives for themselves and their families in the United States. It is essential for our national security to know who resides within our borders.    And this phenomenon is not unique to Colorado; throughout the country, Americans agree that it is time to reform our broken immigration system.    According to a recent poll of 1,000 voters by the Benenson Strategy Group, more than eight in 10 Democratic, Republican and independent voters support Congress passing comprehensive reform, as do 86 percent of voters who are undecided on the 2010 congressional race. Only 14 percent oppose the reform.    Americans agree that comprehensive immigration reform is fair to both taxpayers (81 percent agree) and illegal immigrants (79 percent agree), and 91 percent agree that the comprehensive proposal would help taxpayers by making illegal immigrants pay taxes.    If we secure our borders and crack down on employers who illegally hire, and deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, nearly seven in 10 (68 percent) voters argue that the remaining 12 million illegal immigrants should be required to register, meet conditions and eventually be allowed to apply for citizenship. A whopping 62 percent of self-identified Republicans say they should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship.    Clearly, Americans agree that the economic and national security burdens placed on state and local governments -- not to mention the incredible hardships placed on immigrant families -- because of the failures of federal immigration policy are unfair and that we desperately need meaningful reform. It is rare to find this kind of across-the-board consensus, and it indicates that rather than demagoguery, the American people want action.    Our town hall's other special guest, my colleague Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, formed the United Families movement. It works to bring diverse groups to the table from faith-based organizations, civil rights groups, unions and businesses to demand comprehensive immigration reform.    Thanks to their leadership, progressives and conservatives in Colorado and across the country are working to urge President Obama and Congress to take it up this year.    Amnesty alone is not the solution. We need real reform. We tried amnesty in the late 1980s, and because we never took serious steps at enforcement, we wound up in precisely the same predicament 20 years later. If all we do is pass amnesty, we will likely be having the same debate again a few years.    Likewise, the \"enforcement-only\" policies of the past few years have failed and have resulted only in even more illegal immigration and the separation of American families. Trying to enforce our out-of-touch laws is as foolish and impossible as trying to enforce a law requiring that water flow uphill.    The good news is that we can solve this issue. We can pass practical comprehensive immigration reform. Crafting a solution to this complex problem will require a debate, which should begin without delay. Citizens and elected leaders of this great nation must realize our common goal of putting an end to illegal immigration and demand immigration reform now.    We are a nation of immigrants. Our diversity has always been our strength. We should be thankful that we have even have this problem to consider, thankful that America continues to be a beacon of hope and liberty, and thankful that the best and brightest from across the globe are fighting to start a better life in our country and take part in the American dream.

Michael Eric Dyson says the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. shows that the U.S. is not \"a post-racial paradise.\"    (CNN) -- Last Thursday, President Obama, in his fiery speech before the NAACP Convention, admitted that \"an African-American child is roughly five times as likely as a white child to see the inside of a prison.\"    But he surely couldn't have imagined that only a couple of hours before his oration, one of America's most prominent scholars -- and a distinguished professor at Obama's alma mater, Harvard University -- would breathe cruel and ironic life into that sad statistic.    Henry Louis \"Skip\" Gates Jr. is simply the most powerful and influential black scholar in our nation's history.    He received a doctorate at Cambridge University long before the culture wars became au courant; he was among the first group of figures to receive a MacArthur \"Genius Award\" Fellowship; he wrote the finest work of literary criticism in a generation with \"Signifying Monkey\"; he was named by Time magazine as one of the \"25 Most Influential Americans\"; he has a boatload of honorary degrees; and he has been a ubiquitous media presence and thoughtful interpreter of race and culture for a quarter-century.    But none of that made a bit of difference when Gates returned from a research trip to China to find the front door to his Harvard-owned house jammed and enlisted the assistance of his driver to muscle the door loose. By the time Gates was on the phone with his leasing company, a white policeman had arrived, summoned by a neighbor who spotted two black men looking as if they were unlawfully breaking into the house.    Their stories diverge from here; the policeman says he asked Gates to step outside, Gates refused, the officer entered the home and requested Gates' ID, which he didn't initially produce, and finally had Gates arrested when he followed the officer outside, as Gates was \"exhibiting loud and tumultuous behavior.\"    Gates allegedly shouted, \"Is this how you treat a black man in America?\" and \"You don't know who you're messing with.\" Gates says he showed the officer his ID, demanded that the officer identify himself, which he didn't, and then the professor followed the officer outside to get the policeman's name and badge number when he was arrested by the gaggle of police who had gathered.    Several features of the story scream the presence of lingering bias and racism. A black man in a tony neighborhood simply seems out of place, even to his neighbors.    Had Gates been a white professor trying to get inside his home, and called on his driver to help him jar his door open, he probably wouldn't have as readily aroused the suspicion of neighbors. And when police arrived to check out the premises, they probably wouldn't have been nearly as ready to believe the worst about the occupant of a home who clearly wasn't engaged in a criminal act.    Whatever one believes about what happened, Gates clearly wasn't the beneficiary of the benefit of the doubt, a reasonable expectation since he posed no visible threat.    It is also striking that Gates seems to be the victim of a police mentality that chafes at a challenge of its implicit authority. While that may be true for folk of all races, it seems especially galling to cops to be questioned by a person of color.    How dare black folk believe that, regardless of their station or privilege, they have permission to speak back -- or speak black -- to state-enforced authority, one that, not a decade ago, routinely ravaged black communities in blatant displays of wanton aggression.    It is for good reason that police brutality is a constant concern for black folk; the stakes are often high and harmful. The link between black vulnerability and racial profiling -- of setting in one's collective imagination an image of black men as bad people who are liable to commit mayhem at any moment, and who must therefore always be suspected of wrong and subject to arbitrary forms of control and surveillance -- is evident in the pileup of black bodies, from Amadou Diallo to Sean Bell, that testify to the force of police to impose lethal limits on black survival. Gates rubbed up against the unspoken code that enforces black silence and often violently compels black compliance.    In the end, Gates' unjust treatment speaks volumes about the cynical assertion that we now live in a post-racial paradise.    Gates' crime appears to be a new one in the litany of crimes that black folk commit by virtue of their very existence -- in this case, HWB, or housing while black. If a famous and affluent black man in his own home can be accosted, arrested and humiliated, then all black folk can reasonably expect the same treatment.    To Gates' credit, he realizes that racial profiling happens regularly to poor black folk, and he has pledged to do something about it. But another famous black figure associated with Harvard must renew his pledge to get rid of racial profiling and spare the nation the illusion that his success represents a post-racial America. While it's not likely he'll be unjustly arrested in his House, he's got to make sure that the same privilege extends to millions of other black folk who don't live on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Climbing up through the clouds at a rate faster than the speed of sound, the sky will darken to a deep blue and then to black. Below, entire mountain ranges, coastlines and cities will shift into focus as the horizon bends around the curvature of the Earth - the thin veil of its atmosphere shimmering against a backdrop of stars.    An emerging space tourism industry may give thousands of travelers a new view of Earth.    And then, of course, there will be the feeling of weightlessness.    \"It is just life changing,\" said Col. Richard Searfoss, a retired NASA shuttle commander.\"To be outside the atmosphere and see the curvature of the Earth and see so much land area at once, it gives you a sense of separateness but connectedness.\"    The view of Earth from outer space is a sight that in the history of mankind only a few hundred people have ever seen. But that could soon change as what was once an almost nonexistent space tourism industry slowly matures into what some analysts predict could be a billion dollar enterprise with thousands of passengers by the end of the next decade.    \"This is just the beginning of the golden age of space flight,\" said Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X Prize Foundation, which awarded the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 for the first privately funded human flight to the edge of space.\"Looking back a thousand years from now, this will be the period of time when the human race irrevocably moved off the planet.\"    Look back roughly ten years, though, and the idea of sending tourists into space seemed more like science fiction than a viable business plan, said John Gedmark, executive director of the Personal Spaceflight Federation, a trade association representing the space travel industry.    \"No one ever thought this was real at all,\" said Gedmark.\"It was just completely unthinkable.\"    But that perception began to change in 2001 when American multimillionaire Dennis Tito became the world's first so-called space tourist, traveling aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule to the International Space Station for a price of around $20 million. Four more tourists have since made the trip.    Another major milestone for the industry has been a growing interest and investment from entrepreneurs like Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who financed the development of SpaceShipOne, winner of the Ansari X Prize, and British billionaire Richard Branson, founder of the space tourism company, Virgin Galactic.    \"Since then the activity has been more evenly spread and steadier and more consistent and more determined,\" said Gedmark. \"Now you have a number of companies working on multiple fronts to get people into space.\"    There are now at least a dozen space tourism endeavors worldwide, offering experiences that range from a flight to the fringe of space to astronaut training on a tropical island.    While the companies make up a varied landscape of technological know-how, financial wherewithal and enterprising ideas, they all share one common goal: The desire to conquer what is widely considered to be the final frontier of mankind -- the universe.    \"The human species is about evolution and is about moving forward,\" said Eric Anderson, president of Space Adventures Ltd., the Virginia-based company responsible for arranging civilian trips to the space station on the Soyuz. \"Space is filled with infinite resources that can make our lives better.\"    This October, Richard Garriott, a computer-game developer and son of former NASA astronaut Owen Garriott, is scheduled to become Space Adventures' sixth client to leave the planet followed by a seventh yet-to-be identified passenger next April.    Space Adventures is also planning to build commercial spaceports near Dubai and in Singapore. But Anderson said the next big step involves something slightly further afield - a trip to the Moon.    With a price tag of $100 million per seat, two tourists and a pilot would spend around two weeks board a modified Russian spacecraft with the chance to see an Earth rise from lunar orbit and cruise around the far side of the Moon. The excursion will launch when contracts are finalized with travelers, Space Adventures said.    Suborbital space tourism is also set to take off soon.    For $200,000, Virgin Galactic passengers will undergo several days of training before taking a two-hour flight to the fringe of space - 70 miles above sea level.  From there, the company says, passengers will experience the feeling of weightlessness and see a view of the Earth that spans a 1,000 miles in any direction.    Will Whitehorn, president of Virgin Galactic, said the company has collected $35 million in deposits from 250 would-be space tourists. Another 80,000 have registered interest with the company, he said.    \"That figure has been growing month by month the past year, especially as we get finished building the technology,\" said Whitehorn.    Virgin will begin testing WhiteKnightTwo this summer, said Whitehorn.  The carrier vehicle will ferry suborbital craft SpaceShipTwo, modeled after Ansari X Prize winner SpaceShipOne, 50,000 feet in the sky before releasing it.    \"Once we have tested that sufficiently, we will put the spaceship underneath it,\" said Whitehorn.    Other companies are also jumping in the suborbital space race.    In March, California-based XCOR Aerospace announced plans to build the Lynx, a two-seater rocketship that will carry passengers up into the atmosphere for about $100,000. The vehicle will be the size of a small business jet, capable of making several flights a day, the company said.    And last year, European aerospace giant EADS announced plans for its Astrium space division to develop a line of suborbital jets to satisfy a space tourism market that it predicts could grow to as many as 15,000 passengers a year by 2020.    \"The market is there,\" said Robert Laine, chief technical officer of EADS Astrium.\"The question is how to build the planes that can satisfy that market and to understand what profits at the end we can make out of it.\"    .......................

After the attack, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told CNN that Pakistan was re-evaluating its relationship with the United States.      NATO later called the subsequent mass casualties caused by the strike \"tragic (and) unintended.\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have called the incident a \"tragedy\" and offered condolences, though Washington has not issued a formal apology.      The issue of U.S. and fellow NATO forces coming into Pakistan has been an especially sensitive topic in that country since May, when U.S. commandos killed then al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad without Pakistani leaders' consent      During an exclusive interview last week with CNN, Gilani said the country wants to maintain its relationship with the United States as long as there is mutual respect and respect for Pakistani sovereignty.      Asked directly if Pakistan is getting that respect, the prime minister said: \"At the moment (it is) not.\"      \"If I can't protect the sovereignty of my country, how can we say that this is mutual respect and mutual interest?\" he asked rhetorically.      Pakistan has taken several steps aimed at NATO since the attack.      That includes an announcement Friday, by Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, that NATO and International Security Assistance Force supplies could no longer be routed through Pakistan. The country has served a vital supply route for allied forces who have been fighting for more than a decade in neighboring Afghanistan."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/cbbaf7578e9ededdc10af31f438df9e9f8b1dafe.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who helped White land the plane safely?", "id": "108758", "answers": [{"text": "called Kari Sorenson of Danbury, Connecticut, for help in talking", "answer_start": 3430}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- A man who landed a plane with the assistance of air traffic controllers after the pilot fell unconscious and died said Monday he was \"still in a daze of adrenaline.\"    Doug White said he is certified to fly a single-engine plane, but had no idea how to fly the large turboprop.    \"I'm grateful, thankful to be alive,\" Doug White of Archibald, Louisiana, told CNN affiliate WINK. \"I'm glad my family is safe, but let's don't lose sight of the fact that a man died, and I don't want people to forget that.\"    White, his wife and two daughters were flying from Marco Island, Florida, to Jackson, Mississippi, on Sunday after attending a funeral for White's brother.    White recalled watching and listening as the pilot, Joe Cabuk, conducted his \"climb checklist\" upon takeoff from Florida. After the checklist was complete, he said, Cabuk laid his book down.    About a minute later, White told WINK, he looked at Cabuk, and \"he was just sitting there. He had his chin on his chest, looking down at his lap, but there's nothing in his lap that he needed to be looking at.\"    \"That's when I kind of looked at him for a minute, probably two, three seconds, and I touched him on the shoulder. I said, 'Joe! Joe!, and that's when his head rolled over to the side, and his eyes rolled back in his head, and his arm fell off the armrest ... and I knew if he wasn't gone then, he was in deep distress, but we were in trouble.\"  Listen to White describe seeing the pilot's eyes roll back in his head \u00bb    The plane's autopilot was on, and the plane was at about 5,000 feet and climbing, White said. Although he was a certified single-engine pilot and had about 130 flying hours, he had no idea how to fly the much larger Super King Air two-engine turboprop plane.    \"The only thing I knew how to do up there was talk on the radio,\" White told WINK. \"I've only been up there (in the cockpit) one other time. I made it a point to ask the pilot -- not Joe, but another one -- 'How do I talk on the radio?' and they showed me what button to push.\"    He told his daughters, \" 'Y'all go back there, and I want you to pray hard.' The wife kind of trembled and shook the whole time, and the youngest daughter, Bailey, cried and squalled, and the oldest daughter, Maggie, vomited and threw up three or four times.\"    Although White sounded fairly calm, some tension is evident on recordings released by the Federal Aviation Administration as controllers at Fort Myers, Florida, attempted to talk him through landing at the airport there.    At one point, a controller asked whether the autopilot is still on or whether White is flying the aircraft himself. \"Me and the good Lord are hand-flying this,\" White replied.    He described his mindset as being one of \"focused fear.\"    \"I had a 10,000-pound gorilla by the hand, and it wasn't wanting to cooperate,\" White recounted to WINK.    Asked about his mindset, White said, \"I lost it\" after landing. His emotion can be clearly heard on the recording as he told air traffic controllers in a shaky voice, \"We're down, buddy. Thank you.\"    Air traffic controllers at Miami Center helped White at first, talking him through disengaging the autopilot, turning the plane and beginning his descent. They then handed the plane over to air traffic control at Fort Myers' Southwest Florida International Airport.  Hear audiotape of emergency landing \u00bb    It was a Fort Myers controller who called Kari Sorenson of Danbury, Connecticut, for help in talking White down. A veteran pilot and flight instructor, Sorenson is intimately familiar with the plane White was flying.    \"We started providing him with positions of controls, switches, how to configure the aircraft for landing,\" Sorenson told CNN affiliate WTNH in Connecticut.    Sorenson said he was told that the plane was down and that the controller would call him back. But he said he spent a few tense moments because he didn't know \"if he was down in a positive or negative way.\"    Sorenson credited the air traffic controllers for working as a team in helping White land. \"It was a team of people, and a good team at that,\" he said.    \"The husbands and the wives of air traffic controllers have no idea what their spouses do for a living,\" White said. \"They have no idea, particularly in a busy airspace like Miami or Fort Myers ... they don't make enough money for what they do, the service they provide.\"    He said, \"when something good happens, (air traffic controllers) don't get the high five and the 'attaboys.' I'm gonna give them the attaboy, and I'm going to send them all notes.\"    He said he would also send them restaurant gift certificates so they can take their friends or family out to dinner.    But while he is grateful, White said, he is also saddened at Cabuk's death. \"Joe Cabuk was a father, he was a husband, he was a grandpa, he was a pro at what he did, he was a Christian, he was a great guy and he loved to fly ... this is not all about me.

And you know, more or less, how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford. You've kicked tires, talked to salesmen, taken a few shiny new numbers for a test-drive and you're ready to make the deal.    If you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections.    Except, you're not quite done. You still need to decide whether to buy any of those \"extras\" that your salesperson will always suggest.    Some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding. Others ... maybe not so much.    The list of \"extras\" offered by most dealers, may include paint sealant, fabric protection/leather care, extended warranties, extended 'one price' service contracts, rust/underbody coatings and anti-theft systems, to mention a few.    We wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without. To get to the bottom of it, we thought we would consult an expert -- David Bennett, Manager of Automotive Programs for AAA. As it turns out, like most things in life, the answer often just comes down to what's best for you, depending on your own situation, budget or locale.    Let's address these add-ons one by one:    Paint sealant    \"I think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days, so in most cases you probably don't need that anymore,\" said Bennett, who offered one caveat. \"But that can depend on what part of the country you live in -- what the climate is, whether you get a lot of snow and ice, and what the road crews put down on the road -- whether it is salt, or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint. But generally, as long as you keep your car washed, and wash that salt off of it, and get it waxed regularly, that paint should last without getting the 'add-on' sealer at the dealership. Also, if you get a chip or a ding, get it fixed so the rust doesn't get a chance to set in and spread.\"    Fabric / leather protection    These extras are fairly self-explanatory -- the dealer \"treats\" the upholstered or leather seating with a \"protection\" product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks.    \"This can be a good purchase, but the first question you should ask before buying it is, 'What kind of lifestyle do I lead?' suggests Bennett. \"Do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things? Or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults?\"    Do you eat in the car with some regularity? If so, and you're just too darn messy for your own good, a stain protection might be a good way to go.    \"Also, look at exclusions in the plan,\" advises Bennett. \"If you're a smoker, and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes, and you're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short, that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion. Each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different, and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase, because it might not be a good one for you.\"    If you want to save some cash, one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner. To remove spots from a leather seat, use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth. If the spot still remains, let it sit for a few hours. Repeat, as they say, if necessary. It's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance.    Rustproofing    This is when the dealership applies various rust-inhibiting chemicals, waxes or sealers to the vehicle's undercarriage. It can also be applied to other rust-prone areas. Rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years. Keep in mind that some guarantees require annual \"checkups\" to re-apply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged.    \"I don't think this is necessary in most cases,\" opines Bennett. \"The way most vehicles are constructed today, they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north, where they get a lot of snow.\"    LoJack Car Security System / Anti-theft systems:    The folks at LoJack Car Security Systems report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the U.S. Using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle. But if you want to go the more high-tech \"tracking\" route, using a security system like LoJack may give you more peace of mind. The LoJack System, includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle. The System uses a code that is tied into the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).    Then, when you report that your car has been stolen, the state police crime computer can match code against the state VIN database. This automatically activates the LoJack System in the vehicle -- emitting an inaudible signal. Then, police cruisers and aviation units that have the LoJack tracking system can identify the vehicle's location, track it and recover it. LoJack claims that over 200,000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system, with over 100,000 of those in the U.S.    \"Whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors. If you live in a high-crime area, a system like this could provide you with peace of mind,\" advises Bennett. \"But even if you live in a safe, low-crime district, your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage,\" he notes.    One caveat: Some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen, especially if it has been seriously vandalized, or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems.    Another thing to consider is that owners of GM vehicles that come with its patented OnStar system, probably won't need a theft tracking program, says Bennett. \"Because the system allows OnStar operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen. So if you buy a GM car with the OnStar system, you may want to pass on a LoJack or similar tracking system.\"    Extended warranties    \"This really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle, because most of these extended warranty plans don't kick in until the manufacturer's warranty expires,\" advises Bennett. \"And these days, those manufacturers warranties are three or five years, sometimes longer. \"So if you plan on selling the car after three or five years, it probably doesn't make sense to buy the extended warranty.\"    Some warranties offer transferable policies, which let you \"sell\" the warranty along with the vehicle. Others allow you to \"return\" the warranty for a pro-rated refund.    Bennett also explains that not all warranties are created equal. \"They usually have three levels of warranties: A basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain, for example; while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed -- or an 'exclusionary' extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed. At the top end, the best warranty just covers everything, but that is also the most expensive.\"    Bennett gives an example of one manufacturers warranty. \"For a 2007 Buick, the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain coverage, and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100,000 miles. In fact, that's the same warranty GM offers on their Chevy and Cadillac brands.\"    \"That's a pretty good warranty, so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less, the extended warranty is probably money you don't need to spend.\" E-mail to a friend"}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/b7b468a712daf42a9eb34cb7d0927f6b6cdffc38.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "which cities pose his biggest challenge?", "id": "108764", "answers": [{"text": "mini-cities", "answer_start": 1064}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the best of times, the Champs de Mars square in downtown Port-au-Prince was an awe-inspiring sight for Haitians. The broad boulevard was home to the majestic presidential palace, the seat of the country's power and prestige.      Not anymore.      The century-old gleaming white palace is in ruins. And in the shadow of its wrought-iron gates, the immaculately maintained plaza has been overtaken by row upon haphazard row of makeshift shacks as far as the eye dwells.      These are the new homes of the capital's displaced residents: rickety quarters comprised of bed sheets, propped up on sticks and held together with ropes.      Nearly 500,000 Haitians have moved here, rendered homeless by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake that devastated the impoverished island-nation a week ago.      Throughout the capital, and in other affected areas of the country, similar tent cites have risen -- cramped, squalid encampments filled with the few belongings that residents have salvaged.      As rescue and recovery efforts continue, these mini-cities pose Haiti's next challenge.      \"This is the biggest one,\" National Police Chief Mario Andresol said on Monday. \"We have new area to protect and new people to protect. It's another kind of security we have to ensure. This is the toughest one.\"      Full coverage | Twitter updates      It will be an overwhelming task. The Port-au-Prince police force of 4,000 has plunged to about 1,500 -- the rest of the officers dead, wounded or missing, Andresol said.      Complicating matters, about 4,000 convicted criminals are on the loose. The capital's 95-year-old, badly overcrowded National Penitentiary collapsed after the quake, and the inmates escaped.      \"We have an emergency now,\" Andresol said. \"Because, probably next week, we will have more confusion on the street. The bad guys will be organizing themselves, and they can be the most principal threat to the police and the population.\"      Police presence at these new neighborhoods is sporadic. With electricity lines down throughout the city, residents bunch up their meager belongings into pillows and sleep on them after dark.      iReport: Looking for loved ones      \"You put something down, and they steal it,\" said one resident, who identified himself as Ruben. \"You know, there's no jail in the country. All the prisoners go out. You don't know the good people or bad people. That's why you have to be careful.\"      In some camps, residents have far worse fears.      \"By night, with not enough electricity, some people try to rape and steal and kill people also,\" Andresol said.      U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that he would ask for an additional 2,000 U.N. troops and 1,500 U.N. police officers to bolster the 3,000 U.N. police and soldiers currently deployed in Port-au-Prince.      Haiti police ill-equipped to handle crisis      But security is just one of the many immediate needs that tent-dwellers are praying for.      They await food and medical help.      In one tent, an 8-year-old boy suffers a seizure as family members look on helplessly. In another, a little girl cries in pain, her leg wound oozing.      iReport: I'm alive -- message from Haiti      \"The people of Haiti need help. Quickly! Quickly. We need help!\" a woman screams, tears streaking her face.      In another part of the square, an old man sits quietly, thumbing a Bible.      \"My situation (is) very bad, very bad,\" he says. \"God only know that. God can help me. God can do everything for me.\"      For many residents, there is little else to do but pray -- and wait.      The men mill about aimlessly, wondering when help will arrive. Teenagers rush off when they hear that water and food are available somewhere. Most of the time, they return empty-handed.      Gallery: Devastation in Haiti      With little else to play with, children kick up dirt and squeal in delight. Their mothers squat by portable stoves, fanning the fire with pieces of cardboard.      All around, trash piles up. The stench is unbearable, worsening by the hour under the hot sun.      When night falls, the residents gather by flickering candlelight and sing spirituals to keep their spirits up. Occasionally, gunshots ring in the distance.      Eventually, they drift off to sleep on tattered mattresses and cardboard boxes. Tomorrow, they hope, will bring a better day.

He's also one of the most wanted men in the United States.    Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel, which is battling for turf along the border.    For five years, the State Department has kept a $5 million bounty on his head, calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security.    Guzman, who leads the Sinaloa cartel, is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border.    He recently upped the stakes, ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors, according to the Los Angeles Times.    The cartel's tentacles and those of its chief rival, the Gulf cartel, already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March.    \"No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does,\" said Arabit, who heads the DEA's office in this year's border hot spot, El Paso, Texas. See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S.    A December 2008 report by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities.    So far, the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico, where the cartels' running gunbattles with police, the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year. It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007.    Once again, drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year, Arabit said.  See who the key players are \u00bb    The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker, DEA agents say. But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire.    \"It's coming. I guarantee, it's coming,\" said Michael Sanders, a DEA spokesman in Washington.    Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman's shoot-to-kill instructions aren't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing sources and intelligence memos. The move is seen as dangerously brazen, the newspaper reported. In the past, the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement.    U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border. The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border.    But $700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target. Guzman, who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel, is said to be worth $1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade.    He made this year's Forbes list of the richest of the rich, landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell's Soup fortune. Popular Mexican songs, called narcocorridos, embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader.    \"Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico,\" said security consultant Scott Stewart, invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993.    Stewart, a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor, a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman's worth.    Just a decade ago, Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians, moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean. But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels.    The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back. Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits.    Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, according to the DEA. Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine.    Marijuana became the cartels' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007, bringing in $8.5 billion. Cocaine came in second, at $3.9 billion, and methamphetamine earned $1 billion, a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year.  Watch how marijuana became the cartels' top cash crop \u00bb    The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels, but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border, according to the DEA agents, local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN. The cartels' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa, Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence.    The status and alliances of the players continue to shift. Although the DEA and some analysts disagree, others say the Zetas, a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police, are now running the Gulf cartel.    \"From what we've seen, the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel,\" analyst Stewart said. \"In violent times, soldiers tend to rise to the top.\"    These soldiers are incredibly well-armed, police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime \"Hummer\" Gonzalez Duran. It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles, including AK-47s; 287 grenades; two rocket launchers; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition.    At the very least, the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table. The DEA's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate. Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, a former military man who is also known as \"El Lazco,\" or \"The Executioner.\"    The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors. The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas; Sonora Nogales, across from Nogales, Arizona; and Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, California.    Two years ago, the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas.    It's all about the highways that help move the drugs. Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor, and Juarez has easy access to I-10, a major east-west interstate, and I-25, which runs north to Denver, Colorado. Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5, which heads north all the way to the Canadian border.    Some of the battles are internal, Arabit said. Some are with other cartels. And some, he said, can be attributed to the cartels' \"desperate\" attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers.    As soon as he took office in January 2007, Calderon called out the cartels. He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and, in some cases, do the job of local police. Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office.    The violence involves beheadings, running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches. Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight. The cartels' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets.    \"The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq,\" analyst Stewart said. \"It was simple machismo. The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas.\"    When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant, beneficiaries of their location. Today, they are shadows of their former selves, weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders.    Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997. Known as \"The King of the Skies\" for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes, he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest.    Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery. Two of them later were killed.    His death, along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen, set the stage for the ongoing turf battle. When Cardenas was extradited in 2007, Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez  as well as Nogales.    Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston, Texas, where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros, Mexico.    Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana, and last year, Guzman made a move on that plaza as well.    \"Right now, they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar,\" said the DEA's Elizabeth Kempshall, who heads the agency's office in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix has become the nation's kidnapping capital, largely because of the cartels' increasing presence.    Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition: \"That is the worst thing for any cartel leader, to face justice in the United States.\"    CNN's Eliott C.

The factory of C.F. Martin Guitars in Pennsylvania produces instruments used all over the world.    The sounds of an old guitar seem fitting for the rustic buildings and small towns that you pass through. It's almost as if you're being drawn in, closer and closer to where the sound originates: C.F. Martin Guitars in Nazareth, Pennsylvania.    Walking through the front doors of the factory, nicely tucked into a residential neighborhood, the floors are shiny, the smell of \"newness\" in the air, but somehow it feels old. It feels like you're stepping into a part of history. And you have.    Martin Guitars was established in 1833 when C.F. Martin, along with his family, immigrated to New York from Germany. Upon visiting some friends in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, the Martin family decided to trade in the hustle and bustle of New York for the open space and German heritage of rural Pennsylvania.    The story of Martin Guitars is not just one of building acoustic instruments, but also one of family. The company has passed the business down from one Martin to the next. While many guitar makers have been sold to corporations, Christian Martin IV, the company's current owner, speaks of the responsibility he feels as the fourth-generation family owner.    \"Although other guitar makers may have the name, and they certainly do appreciate the history and the heritage, in my case, it's in my blood.\"    Chris Martin describes the business as \"focused on one thing, and we don't get distracted easily.\" The one thing is perfecting the art of guitar making, and, musicians say, Martin Guitars has done it better than most.    Christian Martin says that what makes his family's line of guitars so popular is the firm belief that the \"guitar is really meant to complement the singer, not to overshadow the person playing it.\" This idea has been the catalyst for some of America's most beloved singer/songwriters for choosing Martin Guitars. Among the artists who have chosen Martin Guitars as their \"tool\" are Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, David Crosby and John Mayer. Country music icons Hank Williams and Johnny Cash also were Martin men.    \"You never know if six months from now Eric Clapton or somebody will be playing the guitar you just worked on,\" says George Molchany, a final inspector at Martin Guitars.  Watch how the guitars are crafted \u00bb    A tour of the new 84,000-square-foot factory is overwhelming, to say the least. Each stop on the tour is a mix between old and new, hands-on craftsmanship and machined process. The hand sanding of the body of a guitar has been replaced with a belt driven sander; the cutting of the edges of the guitar is done with a router that fills the building with so much noise it is often hard to hear the person talking right next to you.    It's a sign that Martin Guitars has changed with the times. Automation has provided the company with more productivity, but if you look in certain corners of the factory, it is still a very hands-on process.    \"It's tedious. Very much so,\" says Willard \"Buddy\" Silvius, a neck fitter at Martin who has been with the company for more than 43 years.    \"You have to get the feel of the wood. You have to know exactly how much you have to chisel off to get the neck to where you want it to fit.\"    Chris Martin says that although the plant has been modernized to produce more guitars, \"there are factories in Asia that make as many guitars in one month as we do in one year.\"    According to Chris Martin, the reason that Martin Guitars has been able to hold off the effects of the troubled economy is because of detailed records that date back nearly two centuries.    \"Every time we celebrated a 25th anniversary, within a year or two, the economy was in shambles. I use that as a way to communicate with my colleagues to say that 'the odds are that we're going to survive this one, too, because we've survived all the others.'\"    Martin Guitars celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2008.    He jokingly adds that \"within a year or two of our 200th anniversary, the economy's going to be in shambles.\"    There is a sense of community within the walls of the factory. Each station that you visit is one in which pride is a shared commodity mostly due to the fact that Martin Guitars employs more than 500 people locally. It's a place where it's hard to find someone who doesn't know your name and, furthermore, exactly what part of the guitar you're building.    Perhaps it is that sense of heritage and community that makes Martin Guitars one of the premier guitar builders. It could be the responsibility of the family name, the desire for perfection on every instrument. What Chris Martin will tell you is that each instrument that comes out of the factory is unique.    \"People choose Martins because they're reliable, they're durable, they have a richness of sound that most other guitars do not. I can't tell you the number of people that tell me the Martin guitar that they own is the best one we ever made.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/13c6ef48c6c1eb89f3613c04c861666d2c071ac8.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the country's population doing?", "id": "108785", "answers": [{"text": "is aging at a faster pace than any other", "answer_start": 1341}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Even before one reaches the front door of Canon's headquarters in Tokyo, one can sense the virtual stampede of employees pouring out of the building exactly at 5:30 p.m.    Japan's birth rate of 1.34 is below the level needed to maintain the country's population.

In addition, Japan's population is aging at a faster pace than any other country in the world.    Analysts say the world's second-largest economy faces its greatest threat from its own social problems, rather than outside forces. And the country desperately needs to make some fixes to its current social and work structures, sociologists say.

Over the past few months, Bret has had a series of extremely close calls. First, in mid-April, he was rushed to the hospital for an emergency appendectomy. Not two weeks later, he had a brain hemorrhage that left him in the ICU for more than a week. \"I'm lucky to be alive,\" he told People at the time.

Forensic investigators and federal police dig bodies out of mass graves in the desert near Juarez.    JUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Heat waves shimmer over the desert. A team of forensic experts clad in white overalls excavate three shallow graves.    The sand gives up nine bodies -- seven men and two women. At least one of the victims' hands were cuffed behind their back. Others had been trussed up with duct tape.    The stale stench reveals that the corpses had been dumped there several days earlier and were decomposing fast.    That grisly find in mid-March came a week after thousands more soldiers had been deployed to Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. The arrival of the soldiers and more federal police agents had coincided with a short lull in the killings.    Snapping photos of the scene from behind the police line was Lucio Soria, photographer for Juarez's main newspaper, El Diario de Juarez, and its sister paper, PM.    PM is a perfect example of Mexico's so-called \"red press,\" newspapers that specialize in covering violence. Soria seems like a perfect ambassador.    \"I've gone for a week and a half without taking pictures of dead people. I was thinking 'Hell, what am I going to do?' At this rate I'll end up taking pictures for the social pages,\" he said.    Soria realizes snapping pictures of blood and gore may seem heartless. But he stays cheerful, cracking dark jokes with colleagues, all while listening to police communications on a radio scanner and searching for clues about where to find the next drug war victim.    \"It might seem ugly, but that's our job,\" Soria said.    He and fellow photographers have been busy in recent months.    Last year, Juarez became the poster city for Mexico's narco-violence, with more than 1,600 gang killings.  Watch musicians play \"narco-ballads\" honoring hitmen \u00bb    This year, Mayor Jose Reyes is trying to turn a page on the killings and make Juarez a showcase for solutions.    Military and federal police convoys patrol the streets around the clock. Cops armed with AR-15 assault rifles, identities obscured by ski masks, hang off pickup trucks that speed around in twos and threes.  Watch cops round up gang suspects \u00bb    Soldiers strike a warlike pose behind heavy machine guns mounted on American-made Humvees.    Whether it's working depends on whom you ask and how hard you read between the lines.    \"I think this is very effective because it closes transport routes for the movement of [cartel] personnel and weapons,\" said a state officer, assigned to guide us, at a federal police checkpoint.    The officer, known only by his call sign Trojan One, seemed confident.    The agent in command of the checkpoint was less convinced.    \"Of course organized crime is trying to avoid us. I'm not sure what methods they use to operate. We don't know how they work,\" said the officer, identifying himself only as Aztec One.    On another day we ran into a three-truck federal police operation staking out a house in a middle-class Juarez neighborhood.  See photos of police, gang life in Mexico \u00bb    The commander said his men believed they had made what he termed a \"major\" cocaine bust. When I met him they had already been waiting almost 24 hours for a judge to issue a search warrant.    When they gained access they discovered some 500 half-gram bags of cocaine. In Juarez those bags sell for around $8. Now do the math, 500 half-gram bags at possibly 60 percent purity means around 150 grams of pure cocaine -- hardly a major strike in the drug war.    Reyes' solution has been to hand the military all civilian police functions, even down to traffic control. Mexico's military has little experience in urban warfare, little experience in policing and has been unable to shake a decades-old reputation for human rights abuses.    When I bump into Reyes at a transfer-of-command ceremony at city hall I ask him what he's doing about alleged corruption and complicity among politicians and businessmen, who permit the cartels to move their shipments and help launder the proceeds.    \"My opinion in Juarez is that that kind of political corruption does not exist,\" he said adamantly.

High hopes: Vinod, left, and Pramod Harith set up thier marketing outsourcing company.      But setting up his marketing outsourcing company just seven months ago was far from a relaxing experience. It's a recent memory that still provokes a momentary look of discomfort.      \"It was just painful,\" he says with a wry smile.      It seems that despite the potential riches to be had by tapping in to all the talent, energy and potential in India, going it alone is still a unique experience in the country, even for those who are used to working there.      Multinational companies may be finding their path into the world of Indian business smooth, but that official approach hasn't trickled down to India's burgeoning business brains with billionaire aspirations.      \"If you're a large company trying to set up a subsidiary and you want to set up in India, a lot of that bureaucracy has gone away, but not for an entrepreneur,\" says Harith who previously worked for Wipro Technologies.      From getting a bank account to securing a line of credit, the same rigid attitude from officialdom remains with decisions made at a glacial place.      \"The government ministry has not been so fast to change. It's become easier, but still a lot of that thinking has not gone away,\" he said.      Harith and his brother Pramod even had trouble registering the name of their company, CMOaxis.      \"We called the company CMOaxis, which stands for Chief Marketing Officer, but for a long time couldn't get the name approved by the registrar of companies here, because they said CMO means Chief Minister's Office. So we had a really tough time, just convincing people.\"      But for the 36-year-old Vinod seeing the bigger picture and potential of his company was worth of all the aggravation.      An October 2007 report into the marketing sector by First Research put its value at around $8 billion. A year on, the potential value might still be there, but tapping in to it during an economic downturn as investors and companies return to \"studying the market\" will be the big challenge.      \"Despite so many global funds being in India it's still very difficult for a start-up to get funding.\"      It certainly is for first time entrepreneurs, as Harith suggests that those with a family history in business or politics where it's easier to secure backing find things much easier.      \"In PR first generation entrepreneur successes are still there but you can count them on the fingers of one hand.      \"The understanding just isn't there in a part of India that is more used to the garment industry and traditional forms of business,\" says Pramod Harith, Vinod's brother and business partner.      Different industries, same problems      700 miles (1,127 kilometers) away in Pune, Jesh Krishna Murthy is busy with his fledgling animation company Anibrain.      After 13 years working abroad he returned to India to find the same frustrations as the Hariths in setting up the business.      \"If you are going to do business in India, there is a lot of red tape and corruption. You have to learn to deal with, but it is very frustrating. If you're caught up in some regulation and the laws are kind of ambiguous and there's no right or wrong the authorities can give you a lot of trouble,\" he said.      If you can't deal with it, then you're doing business in the wrong country. It is stupid, but part and parcel of being in India.\"      Krishna Murthy brought much of Anibrain's business contacts with him, doing post-production graphics on films such as \"Lust Caution\" John Woo's \"Red Cliff\" and big budget Hollywood flicks, much of the hard work comes in maintaining quality.      \"Getting the job is the easier part; it's delivering it to the quality that's expected and with the service levels that expected that the harder part. We work on that day in and day out,\" he said.      Having worked abroad he has an acute understanding of the differences between various work cultures and attitudes and the thought of working for a graphics company in India was almost unthinkable.      \"There was no lack of talent in terms of the animators, but the way in which the animation studios were managed was lacking.      \"I found it disheartening that the people who were managing these companies only cared about the hardware and how much money was pumped into the software, forgetting that it's about people.

Changing attitudes      Facing rigid attitudes from clients has been a challenge for both Krishna Murthy and the Hariths, but there is the potentially bigger task of changing attitudes closer to home.      \"The mindset has changed in South India, thanks to the growth in the IT sector here and rise in entrepreneurs. Until this happened, doing business was not thought of as a very hot thing to do -- in traditional families in South India, if you're doing business then there's something wrong with you,\" said Harith.      Vinod and Pramod were both born and raised in Chennai and the desire to blaze their own trail and be part of the positive changes to business and society in their hometown was one of their motivating forces.      For Krishna Murthy the pains, pitfall but pleasures of setting up shop in India are all worth the effort:      \"For me it was challenge. I wanted to be in India and to do the kind of high end film graphics that you would have thought couldn't be done in India with Indian talent that hadn't been as trained. To do it you have to be a bit of a sadist, but that's part of the charm of India.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/da65757d05c1d3c2be3d4229f7df20a07cb6a725.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where did the U.N.

U.N. vehicles on Monday pass between lines of civilians fleeing fighting north of Goma, Congo.    U.N. helicopter gunships, supporting national army forces on the ground, fired on rebels from the Congress for the Defense of the People in an effort to halt their advance on the village of Kibumba.    CNDP is the French acronym for National Congress for the Defense of the People, a Congolese rebel group under renegade general Laurent Nkunda.    The village of Kibumba is the location of a U.N.-administered internally displaced peoples camp, just 12 \u00bd miles (20 kilometers) north of the provincial capital, Goma, Bonnardeaux said.    Renewed fighting erupted Sunday when the CNDP seized a major military camp and gorilla park, according to U.N. and park officials. The U.N. brokered peace accord in the area in January.    On Monday, thousands fleeing Kibumba spurred violent demonstrations in front of the U.N. compound in Goma. The group was angry that a 17,000-person U.N. security force has been unable to protect them from renewed bouts of violence in the country, a U.N. spokesman told CNN.    A U.N. spokesman said the U.N.'s mission in Congo was \"under attack\" on Monday.    A mission staff member inside the U.N. compound, who did not want to give his name for security reasons, said U.N. security forces had returned fire in an attempt to disperse angry crowds near the U.N. compound. Gunshots could be heard as he spoke on the phone.    He said the attack had resulted in several deaths. U.N. officials confirmed one dead in Goma as a result of Monday's demonstrations.    The assault died down later in the day, a U.N. spokesman said, but people continued to pelt the building.    It was unclear who was attacking, but the staff member told CNN the people were from a village that had been taken over by the CNDP, a Congolese renegade group led by Gen. Laurent Nkunda that seized a major military camp and gorilla park in a renewed bout of heavy fighting Sunday.    Thousands of civilians were reportedly fleeing the fighting. Pictures from the region showed long lines of people walking along roads carrying their belongings.  Watch how refugees line roads to get away \u00bb    Soldiers who abandoned the military camp were retreating in vehicles on a main road outside of Goma on Monday, angrily honking their horns at civilians who got in their way, The Associated Press reported.    Bertrand Bisimwa, a spokesman for the rebels, told the AP that rebel fighters had moved to within 7 miles (11 kilometers) of Goma.    The latest fighting comes after the collapse on Sunday of a tenuous week-old U.N.-brokered cease-fire between rebels and government forces.    According to U.N. spokesman Nick Birnback, thousands of displaced civilians in the city of Goma were throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails, angry that a 17,000-person U.N. security force has been unable to protect them from the violence.    \"The situation in Goma is very volatile,\" he said. \"But MONUC is taking all available measures to stabilize the situation.\"   Watch more about the fighting \u00bb    The U.N. mission -- known by its French acronym, MONUC -- is in Goma, which is along Congo's border with Rwanda.    Although the civil war in Congo -- once known as Zaire -- officially ended in 2003, recent fighting in eastern Congo between government forces and CNDP rebels under has caused tens of thousands to flee their homes, according to U.N. spokesman Michele Bonnardeaux.  Watch ranger describe the violence \u00bb    The conflict and humanitarian crisis in Congo have taken the lives of 5.4 million people since 1998, and 45,000 people die there every month, according to an International Rescue Committee report in January.

The official said all countries, especially Congo and Rwanda, \"need to work together\" to rein in \"militia groups and other negative forces.\"    Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer will travel to Congo and Rwanda to urge both governments to take action, the official said.    U.N.

Although the short statement announcing Jackson's news conference did not reveal any details, Britain's Sky News reported Wednesday that the 50-year-old King of Pop has agreed to a series of summer concerts at the O2.    Rumors have circulated for years about a possible Jackson concert comeback, just as speculation has abounded about his physical and financial health.    Jackson's reclusive lifestyle -- and a photo last year of him being pushed in a wheelchair -- created fertile ground for health rumors.    When a London tabloid reported in December that Jackson was battling a potentially fatal disease that required a life-saving lung transplant, his publicist responded that he was \"in fine health\" and that the story was \"a total fabrication.\"    Jackson's financial troubles in the past year have included the near-foreclosure of his Neverland Ranch in California, which he later sold.

The pie in the White House is dangerously good.\" -- Oprah Winfrey  Michelle Obama is the first person to join Oprah Winfrey on the cover of O magazine  Oprah Winfrey: How are you a different woman today than you were when Barack Obama announced his candidacy in 2007?  Michelle Obama: I'm more optimistic. More hopeful. It comes from traveling all over America and connecting with so many different people. And this was long before anyone thought Barack had a chance. This was the kindness of strangers. I think we should all have to get to know one another around kitchen tables. It changed me. It's helped me to give other people the benefit of the doubt.  Winfrey: What did you see that changed you?  Obama: I saw our shared values. We fundamentally want the same things for ourselves and for each other. We want our kids to be safe and to grow up with some resources and aspire to a slightly better life than ours. No one's looking for a handout. People just want fairness and opportunity. Oprah.com:The heart and mind of Michelle Obama  Winfrey: That's so good to hear. Because you know what? We live in an \"American Idol\" culture where it seems like everyone just wants to be in the spotlight.  Obama: That's not the America I saw. People value their communities. They're rooting for one another. Even in places where I thought people wouldn't accept or relate to me, I always walked out feeling like, \"Wow -- that was fun.\"  That changed me. And it helped prepare me for this. Because I think if you're going to be first lady, you have to believe in the possibility of what this country stands for. You have to see it in action and know what you're working toward. Oprah.com: How Michelle gets unstuck  Winfrey: That's so interesting -- and it all came from sitting around kitchen tables. Speaking of which, did you change your diet during the campaign?  Obama: When we first started running, my big concern was making sure we ate well on the road. So we started looking at our diet, trying to eliminate junk, getting seasonal fruits and vegetables that were grown locally. We walked the kids through reading labels. We talked about why one juice might be better than another.  Winfrey: That's right. In addition to eating well, do you work out?  Obama: Yes. There's a small gym here that has everything we need. I work out about four or five days a week -- and Barack does six. He's a workout zealot.  Winfrey: Well, you look better than ever -- despite the rumors that you've got a baby bump.  Obama: [Laughter.] I know -- I was like, \"Baby bump? As hard as I work on my abs?!\"  Winfrey: Okay, so that's settled. Back to exercise. You do treadmill?  Obama: I do treadmill, I do weights  Winfrey: I think anyone who saw you on the cover of Vogue knows you do weights. Those arms!  Obama: I also do some jump rope, some kickboxing -- and I'd like to take up Pilates, if I could figure out whether there's time. After I had Malia, I began to prioritize exercise because I realized that my happiness is tied to how I feel about myself. I want my girls to see a mother who takes care of herself, even if that means I have to get up at 4:30 so I can do a workout.  Winfrey: When you first told me that a few years ago, I was like, \"You get up at 4:30 to work out?\"  Obama: Well, I just started thinking, if I had to get up to go to work, I'd get up and go to work. If I had to get up to take care of my kids, I'd get up to do that. But when it comes to yourself, then it's suddenly, \"Oh, I can't get up at 4:30.\" So I had to change that. If I don't exercise, I won't feel good. I'll get depressed. Of course, it's easier to do it here, because I have much more support now. But I always think about women who don't have support. That's why work-family balance isn't just a policy conversation; it's about changing the expectations of who we have to be as women and parents.  Winfrey: What you mentioned earlier is key: We have to ask for help. You can't do it all. It's impossible.  Obama: That's a conversation I'd love for us to have as a society. How do we set expectations that are attainable?  Winfrey: So what do you know for sure, Michelle Obama?  Obama: I know that all I can do is be the best me that I can. And live life with some gusto. Giving back is a big part of that. How am I going to share this experience with the American people? I'm always thinking about that.

Moshe Nunez and his family moved to Crown Heights, a New York neighborhood with thousands of Hasidic Jews.    Like most families in their Crown Heights neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, their Jewish Sabbath meal includes blessings over the wine and bread, the company of family and friends and excellent food.    But for the Nunez family, the Sabbath table would not be complete without salsa picada and jalapeno dip.    Moshe Nunez, an information technology consultant and motivational speaker, was born to a Mexican father and American mother and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico.    His wife, ChanaLeah, grew up in Panama, the daughter of a Salvadoran mother and American-born father.    \"Our home is a Latin American home,\" Nunez says.    \"We bring into our home a mixture of the American and Latin culture, and that's reflected in the way we eat. We also enjoy hosting guests, so it's a very Hispanic thing, and a Jewish thing.\"    The couple and their two children moved to Brooklyn's Crown Heights area about five years ago so their son, Michael, 17, and daughter, Simcha, 18, could have \"the best Jewish education available,\" Nunez says.    Crown Heights is the headquarters of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a branch of Hasidism that is itself a form of Orthodox Judaism. Among the thousands of Hasidic families in the neighborhood, a significant number are also Latinos, Nunez says.    \"There are a lot of Latin American Jews here,\" Nunez says. \"Some of them have moved from countries like Venezuela, Colombia and Argentina, where there's political unrest. We make a life here, settle down and become part of the fabric of American society, but we still don't lose our roots.\" Join the conversation: How has America changed Latinos?    Many non-Jewish Latinos are surprised to see Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn who speak Spanish, carry on their Hispanic traditions and even keep up with soccer scores from their home countries, Nunez says.    Although Moshe and ChanaLeah Nunez were raised in Christian homes, they believe that Moshe's family name is proof that his ancestors are Marranos -- Jews who were forced to denounce or abandon their faith centuries ago in Europe.    Moshe Nunez began studying his family genealogy about 13 years ago, while the family was living in Atlanta, Georgia.    He met Lorraine Nunez, a woman raised as a Christian who believed she was a direct descendant of Samuel Nunez, a Portuguese physician who fled Europe in the early 1700s to help start one of the oldest Jewish synagogues in the United States, Congregation Mikve Israel in Savannah, Georgia.    Like other Marranos living in Europe, Samuel Nunez pretended to be Catholic and practiced Judaism in secret, according to Chabad.org, the Chabad-Lubavitch movement's Web site.    Meeting Lorraine Nunez inspired Moshe Nunez -- who was still going by his Christian name, Marco -- to further explore his own genealogy.    ChanaLeah -- who was going by her Christian name, Jacqueline -- had already known that her grandfather, a well-known army colonel in El Salvador, was Jewish. Like many Jews of his time, he hid his Judaism and married a non-Jewish woman.    Marco and Jacqueline believed that their descendants were also Marranos from Spain and Portugal who had to hide their Judaism for fear of persecution.    \"The Nunez family started as a Jewish name,\" Moshe Nunez says. \"During the Inquisition they were forced to convert or practice their faith in secret. Most of the Nunez family... like mine assimilated and lost their Judaism.\"  Watch Nunez talk about his life in Crown Heights \u00bb    While researching his genealogy, Moshe Nunez also began to study the Bible more closely, including the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament.    \"When I began studying the Torah, I saw that the Sabbath was on Saturday and not Sunday,\" he says.    \"That opened [a] Pandora's Box,\" he says, figuring that \"if the Jews had the Sabbath right, maybe they have other stuff right, too.\"    Around that time, the Nunez family relocated to Milan, Italy, for Nunez' work as a consultant. Marco and Jacqueline -- who changed their names to the Hebrew Moshe and ChanaLeah while in Italy -- continued their Judaic studies under the tutelage of Orthodox rabbis and decided to undergo an Orthodox conversion to Judaism.    \"When I got to Italy and continued to research our family name and studied the Torah, I decided we were going to live a Jewish life,\" Nunez says.    The Jewish community in Milan welcomed the family \"with open arms,\" Moshe said. \"The rabbi said to me, 'Moshe, you are Jewish, you were always Jewish.'\"    Moshe says he and ChanaLeah \"took every step together,\" going through a formal conversion process. As part of the process Moshe and his son had ritual circumcisions. (They had both been circumcised at birth.)    The final step was for the family to appear before a Beit Din, or religious council, to approve the conversion.    \"We decided we had to make our full return to Judaism, and we had such good mazal (luck) because the rabbis made it relatively easy. They saw that we were serious people that had studied the religion,\" Nunez says.    The Nunez family's story is not out of the ordinary, says Rabbi Shea Rubenstein, an Argentine rabbi who leads the Jewish Latin American Connection at The Shul in Surfside, Florida.    \"We have a very vibrant synagogue, and a very large percentage happen to be from Spanish background from countries such as Venezuela, Peru, Argentina, Mexico and Cuba,\" the rabbi says.    Rubenstein says that quite a few non-Jewish Hispanics come to The Shul to learn more about Judaism, and while they may not be able to prove they are Jewish, they believe they are descendants of Jews and seek to reconnect with their Jewish roots.    If a person wants to practice Judaism but cannot verify their Jewish roots, Rubenstein recommends they go through a formal conversion as the Nunez family did.    \"It's difficult to verify because there's some 400 or 500 years of history that people cannot trace, especially since Judaism is passed through the mother and the last name reflects that of the father,\" Rubenstein says.    Inspired by their experiences, Moshe and ChanaLeah -- both songwriters and musicians -- wrote a song called \"Jews of Spain,\" with lyrics in Spanish, English and Hebrew. Nunez recorded the song, part of the album \"Kol Haneshema (Every Soul).\"    Aside from his work as a consultant and musician, Nunez leads seminars, conducts a weekly program called Quality Life Now at the Empire State Building and teaches weekly Webinars from his Brooklyn home. His seminars, taught in both Spanish and English, focus on seven core values found in the Old Testament.    The seven values are often referred to as the Noahide Laws. According to the Bible, the laws were given from God to Noah to serve as a moral code for all humankind.    \"I've taken the seven Noahide Laws and I teach them as universal core values, so everyday people can apply them to their lifestyle,\" Nunez says.    He says he hopes to share his teachings with all of mankind, regardless of religion, to help them lead a more meaningful life.    \"Sharing the knowledge of Torah to the world through education, songs and acts of kindness will help ensure that what happened to the Marranos during the Inquisition will never happen again.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/0d32aa0feee7f1ade275806a0d33191c2723d051.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What caused two detainees to leave with minor bruises?", "id": "108819", "answers": [{"text": "assaulting", "answer_start": 68}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has charged six guards accused of assaulting detainees in May at Camp Bucca in Iraq, naval officials said Thursday.

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Recently, VBS headed to Naples, the capital of the Campania region in southern Italy, to shoot two documentaries about the Camorra, the most powerful but least understood of the Italian crime cartels.      One piece was about the peculiar world of the Camorra's homegrown Neapolitan pop stars, known as Neomelodics. The other, excerpted here, focused on the environmental emergency brought on by the Camorra's manipulation of garbage disposal in the region. Each proved to be a strange and infuriating experience.      The daytime hours were spent visiting housing blocks where every family had reported at least one case of cancer because of illegal toxic waste dumps behind their homes. Our evenings, however, were spent at town square celebrations sponsored by the Camorra two blocks away and attended by the same families we had met earlier that day. The Camorra, it was suddenly clear, was dumping toxic waste in people's backyards and then hosting Neomelodic pop concerts in their front yards.      See the rest of Toxic: Napoli at VBS.TV      Today, the Camorra's Naples is Italy on steroids, and it's the result of a marriage of convenience between two powerful Italian forces. Neapolitans we met were, on the one hand, fed up with the garbage situation. On the other, very few had any interest in pointing fingers at the Camorra.      The Gerlando family is a prime example. On one of the last days of our shoot, we spent an afternoon with sheep farmers Patrizia and Mario Gerlando at their home in the Campanian countryside.      The Gerlandos were forced to leave their home in the town of Acerra (a suburb of Naples) because all of their sheep were mutating and dying due to the high levels of dioxin in the pastures where they grazed. Despite Acerra being the most well-documented case of the Camorra's involvement in Campania's environmental crisis, after the cameras were packed away, Mario and Patrizia told us that the Camorra had nothing to do with anything and that it would take someone like Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to come fix the situation."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/02e00a31289a21f8c63585496737e96889abb459.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What did Barack Obama promise the girls", "id": "108821", "answers": [{"text": "and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January.", "answer_start": 100}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(Mental Floss) -- In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January.

Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus    Calvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets.    After taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections.    He had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo \u00bb    Billy was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age.    He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.)    Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success.    He sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring. Mental Floss: 7 crafty zoo escapes    2. The White House gators    Herbert Hoover wanted to put a chicken in every pot, a car in every garage, and ... a gator in the Oval Office? It's true.    Hoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds.    Sound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests.    3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion    What do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog.    In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend.    FDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala.    After that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went.    The dog \"gave\" $1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala.    Fala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches. When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents, he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him, but leave Fala alone.    \"You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him -- at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or 20 million dollars -- his Scotch soul was furious.    \"He has not been the same dog since!\"    Fala stayed with FDR until the President's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952. Mental Floss: 6 utterly loyal dogs    4. Millie: Literary sensation    When George H.W. Bush took office in 1989, he brought his pet springer spaniel Millie to the White House.    The bubbly canine won over the nation's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush.    Millie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989.    Just as her master helped slip one of his boys into the White House, so did Millie: when George W. Bush moved into the Oval Office, so did his dog, Millie's son Spot Fetcher.    5. Barney, Miss Beazley & India: The current residents    Sadly, Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004, but the Bushes aren't pet-deprived now.    They have a pair of Scottish Terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley, both of whom have websites and appear in White House-produced web videos. (Your tax dollars adorably at work!) The Bushes also have a black cat named India, who also goes by \"Willie.\"  Watch Barney bite a reporter \u00bb    The name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs \"Bush.\"    The name wasn't meant to be controversial, though; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben \"El Indio\" Sierra, who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team. Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher.    Other first pets of note:    Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison's two opossums. Harrison's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers.    Pauline -- The last cow to live at the White House. She made milk for President Taft's consumption.    Old Ike -- To save cash during World War I, Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House's groundskeeping duties. Old Ike, a ram, supposedly chewed tobacco.    Laddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 \"interview\" with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs.    Liberty -- Gerald Ford's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President's conversations.    Socks and Buddy -- President Clinton's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office. Socks didn't like Buddy's youthful friendliness, so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times. The tensions were so bad that the family couldn't keep both pets at the end of Bill's second term, so Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie.    Gamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House.    Two tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo.    Satan -- One of Abigail Adams' unfortunately named dogs. She called the other one Juno.    Jonathan Edwards -- Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name, he wrote to a friend, \"partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear's character.\"    Dr. Johnson, Bishop Doane, Fighting Bob Evans, and Father O'Grady -- Teddy Roosevelt's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs.    Josiah -- Roosevelt also had a pet badger, of course.    Bonus trivia: Checkers    Nixon's dog was immortalized in the \"Checkers speech,\" which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions.    He said the only gift he'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters. Mental Floss: Why was the 'Checkers speech' so important?    Checkers, however, was never the White House dog. This scandal bubbled up while Nixon was Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 election, and Nixon gave the Checkers speech to convince Republicans to keep him on the ticket.    Although the speech was a success and Nixon later made it to the White House, Checkers never got to be First Dog; he passed away in 1964.

Around 11:25 p.m. Friday, a fight broke out among members of the Hell's Angels and Vagos clubs in front of the Trader Dick's bar inside John Ascuaga's Nugget, a family-owned casino in Sparks, that city's deputy police chief Brian Allen told reporters.      Police in Sparks, which is just east of Reno, responded with assistance from overhead helicopters after hearing several people involved in the brawl had guns and that shots were fired. Authorities earlier reported that as many as 30 people total took part in the altercation.      They came upon what Sparks police Lt. Pete Krall described earlier Saturday as a \"very chaotic scene.\" That included \"multiple gunshot victims\" who were transported to area hospitals, according to Allen.      One Hell's Angels member died from his wounds, while two associated with Vagos suffered what the deputy chief described as \"non-life-threatening\" injuries. No bystanders or casino employees were wounded in the incident, he added.      The incident, as well a \"subsequent drive-by shooting\" elsewhere in the city, prompted the declaration of a \"state of emergency\" in Sparks, the city announced late Saturday afternoon on its website.      \"Whenever you have people who enter our city with bad intentions, bad things are going to happen,\" Sparks Mayor Geno Martini said during a press conference Saturday. \"That's what happened here last night.\"      Sparks police have arrested \"one Hell's Angels member for his involvement in the fight and subsequent shooting,\" Allen said. \"Other law enforcement agencies made additional arrests on the outskirts of the incident, and we are coordinating to determine their ... involvement in the case.\"      Renown Medical Center, located in Reno, announced on its website at 1:45 p.m. Saturday that it had \"applied extra security measures and locked all exterior access to the hospital, except for (one) emergency room entrance\" because of the shooting.      By 3 p.m., the hospital said it would be \"easing precautionary security measures for various entrances/exits,\" though there would be \"limited access\" for certain areas.      The incident erupted in the midst of the Street Vibrations Fall Rally, an event that began Wednesday and is set to continue into Sunday in Reno.      Allen said that since the 18th annual event recently expanded into Sparks, there have been no incidents such as the one Friday night. He did state that, after the shooting, Reno, Sparks and Washoe County authorities are \"increasing personnel at the event.\"      The event's activities in Sparks were canceled through the weekend because of the shooting, the city announced Saturday afternoon. Still, hours earlier, its mayor said the incident -- while worrisome -- shouldn't cast a negative light on all motorcycle club members.      \"I hope the people out there won't judge the motorcycle community by the incident that happened last night,\" said Martini. \"I don't think it's a true picture.\"      CNN's Michael Martinez, Maggie Schneider and Divina Mims contributed to this report."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/de2729de82c55df80dc7aaecf2e3b76acebf38a1.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what is ampyra appropiate for", "id": "108824", "answers": [{"text": "MS therapy", "answer_start": 452}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The second-to-last time EJ Levy was at Disney World, she used a scooter to navigate the enormous park. Her legs were weak and she suffered from foot drop caused by multiple sclerosis. That was 4\u00bd years ago. On her most recent trip, a few months ago, Levy walked the entire time, thanks in part to a drug approved by the FDA on Friday.      The FDA says the drug, Ampyra (generic name dalfampridine, formerly known as fampridine), is the first MS therapy that is taken orally and the first of its kind to receive FDA approval. It is designed help people with any type of MS improve their walking speed.      The prime of her life      In 2002, Levy was in her 30s and an active hiker and skier with a job on Wall Street and later in San Francisco, California. But her life took a turn when she started stumbling, falling down and dragging her right leg. Her doctor's diagnosis? Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis, a less common form of MS and, as the name implies, one that usually plagues people with the disease after its initial course.      The National Multiple Sclerosis Society defines MS as a \"chronic, often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.\" Symptoms of MS include extreme fatigue, difficulty walking, problems with memory and heat sensitivity.      The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting, in which people have acute attacks followed by periods of remission. In secondary progressive, however, the disease worsens steadily and there are no acute flare-ups. People with relapsing-remitting may later develop secondary progressive MS.      Levy says she lived in the same building as her parents at one point because she needed them to help take care of her. She says she mostly stayed at home, and when she did venture out she usually walked only a block or two with a cane. She relied on a wheelchair for longer distances.      She says she realized she would eventually be unable to walk. \"I was scared of being in a wheelchair. I was scared of getting worse and worse. I had traveled around the world before I got sick, I was super independent,\" Levy says.      Trying things out      After exhausting the usual MS treatments -- and developing intolerable side effects -- Levy also became frustrated that the treatments were primarily designed for people with the more common course of the disease, and not the secondary progressive course.      Levy's neurologist then discussed the possibility of trying 4-aminopyradine -- a version of the same drug the FDA approved Friday that was available only through compounding pharmacies. Just three days after taking the drug, Levy was able to walk unassisted.      \"I never thought I could put my cane away for good,\" she said.      Now she hopes the same drug that helped her will be able to help other people. She addressed an FDA advisory panel late last year and recommended approval of it.      \"It's about quality of life,\" Levy says.      How it works      Two phase III clinical trials of Ampyra showed 35 and 43 percent of patients experienced, on average, a consistent improvement in their walking speed, increasing it by about 25 percent.      According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, even a modest improvement in walking ability could mean that thousands of people could benefit from the drug.      Dr. John Richert, executive vice president of Research & Clinical Programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, says the drug can be used by most people with MS. However, the drug is not for people with a history of seizures or people who have moderate to severe kidney disease.      Richert says approval means patients can now skip the compounding pharmacy and get a consistent, exact dosage in a guaranteed time-released formula, which would lower the risk of getting a toxic dose instead of a therapeutic dose.      \"It's likely that further study and clinical practice may help to determine the extent to which the drug may impact other functions, and may also provide hints as to which patients are most likely to respond positively to the therapy,\" Richert said.      He added that the drug would not help nerves that have been destroyed and emphasized that people should try the drug to see if it works for them.      Ampyra may not work for everyone. \"Like any medication, people will have different responses, so they should talk to their doctors about whether it's appropriate to start therapy on Ampyra,\" according to a spokesperson from Acorda, Ampyra's manufacturer.      Moving with MS      Today, Levy is doing well. She established the not-for-profit organization MS Hope for a Cure, and in three years the organization has raised $1.8 million for research and programs to help people living with MS.      She has also completed several five-mile hikes. But she says she is always conscious of where she steps. She says she occasionally has some weakness in her leg, but that she is thankful for every day: \"I don't ever take jumping out of bed for granted.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/cef9c0fc07ccd15bae11cdcc11c863292ed20954.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who refused fame and money?", "id": "108825", "answers": [{"text": "Connie Nielsen", "answer_start": 37}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "COPENHAGEN, Denamrk (CNN) -- Actress Connie Nielsen hit the big time when she starred in \"Gladiator\" as Lucilla, sister of the deranged Emperor Commodus. Since then she has appeared in hit movies including \"One Hour Photo\" and \"The Hunted\".    Connie Nielsen has always refused to play the Hollywood fame game.    But Nielsen has refused to play the Hollywood fame game and seems drawn to challenging roles in controversial movies, including \"The Situation\", about the current Iraq war, and \"Battle in Seattle\", about the anti-globalization riots that took place in Seattle in 1999.    Nielsen now lives in the US and returns to Copenhagen every year. She talks to My City, My Life about what makes the city, and its people, so special.    CNN: How do you define yourself?    Connie Nielsen: I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business. I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth. That's what I want from my art, that's what I aspire to.    I try to combine my work with my family, that's what I aspire to. I don't say that's the only thing. It's not all work and family, because otherwise you would be saying no to the many other things in life and there are many other things.    CNN: The people here are supposed to be incredibly happy -- what do you think?    Connie Nielsen: I think it's funny in a way because when I grew up here it was very unusual to hear the word \"happiness\". If you asked somebody, \"what do you wish for in life?\" they wouldn't say \"happiness.\"    I would have answered \"excitement, knowledge,\" God knows -- I mean, many, many different things, but certainly not \"happiness\". It seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular. And I think that a lot of Danes kind of feel like that about being the happiest people in the world.    CNN: Is there anything you'd like to change about the city?    Connie Nielsen: Anywhere there are social buildings that stuff people into boxes, concentrate poor people there. It's specific to any big city. There was an effort to create buildings that concentrate these people very closely, and their social problems. They are still around in New York, Paris, London and here too.    So if I could change anything about Copenhagen, or any other major big city, I would change the way we build buildings or housing for lower income people. I don't think people who are already burdened with social, economic, psychological situations, dysfunctional families, need to be burdened with other people with the same problems.    CNN: Is the city politically driven?    Connie Nielsen: I don't think I can remember a moment in my life where people didn't discuss politics. People discuss politics at the table. I think some of the first information I received was politically charged (laughs). It was at a time when girls were being told, \"Why don't you go and learn how to repair machines rather than learn to repair your jumper? Why don't you learn to cut wood rather than learn to keep a house clean?\" in school.    It was to make us conscious of what we were, how we defined ourselves and why you would accept one concept of yourself rather than another. Have you searched through the truth of that concept? Have you deconstructed? Have you made sure that its foundations are valid? That's how I grew up and I think it was wonderful.    CNN: How would you describe the city architecturally?    Connie Nielsen: It's everything here from very late renaissance to this 19th century golden age we had here. It's that, intermixed with pure Danish modernism. I love the juxtaposition of it all. I love when we bring in metaphors for our past as well.    CNN: A lot of the places you have taken us to have been very romantic, do you think there is a fairy tale quality to Copenhagen?    Connie Nielsen: An alternative society ... yes I do, I do feel that. I do feel that most things are possible here. I can dream here. I can imagine.    CNN: What is it about the city that makes people creative?    Connie Nielsen: Well, we have a very, very long winter and it gets a little boring, so you better think of something to do! It can get deathly boring, so you start using your imagination. Sometimes it's necessity that produces it, because you need to do something.    CNN: Is there something about the people here that want to change things for the better?    Connie Nielsen: I think so -- I think we're an idealistic people. I think there are disillusioned people everywhere, there are doubters everywhere, but I do think there are constructive people here; I do think that people believe in people.    CNN: Do you take any inspiration from the city?    Connie Nielsen: Yes, yes I do. Whenever I come back here I remember that I want to write poetry (laughs). I want to take more time to sit and paint some more. I want to do so many more things whenever I come back -- I'm always reminded of that when I come here.    CNN: You've lived in lots of cities all over the world and still do. Why is Copenhagen special to you?    Connie Nielsen: I was born here and it's the capital of my home country. It's also immensely beautiful. Many of my friends live here and much of my partner's family lives here too and so we bring our kids back here every year.    It holds all the museums that hold our history, our culture, and I take our children there and I go there for my own pleasure all the time. I love going to museums.    I love this city and I love cities that are on the water. I love the water element, specifically the sea. I grew up on the sea and I grew up sailing -- I love sailing -- and the presence of the sea gives the air and the light a very special quality that I absolutely adore.    CNN: It seems that for a small place it has a lot of cultural influence.    Connie Nielsen: Yes, it's sort of a little pearl in the middle of the seas. There's a lot of traffic through this place, from the east, west, north and south. And we are the southern part of the north, so everything from the south comes up here on its way towards the north, and the opposite. And it has left its mark.    We are definitely some kind of place where culture is being deposited over and over and over again, but it also springs from here. It's the kind of place that attracts creative people and so it springs from here too.    CNN: If Copenhagen was a person, how would you describe it?    Connie Nielsen: If Copenhagen were a person, that person would be generous, beautiful, elderly, but with a flair. A human being that has certain propensities for quarrelling, filled with imagination and with appetite for the new and with respect for the old -- somebody who takes good care of things and of people."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/32eba890fecfde97d14ad42d9ce57aae1223c55a.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What doctor with what celebrity?", "id": "108831", "answers": [{"text": "operated on hip-hop star Kanye West's mother", "answer_start": 57}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The plastic surgeon who operated on hip-hop star Kanye West's mother the day before she died abruptly walked off the set of CNN's \"Larry King Live\" Tuesday, saying he was honoring a request from her family.    \"I think I'm taking up your air time,\" Dr. Jan Adams tells CNN's Larry King before walking off.    \"I want to thank you for this opportunity,\" Dr. Jan Adams told King. \"Basically, I had come here to talk about things in the press that aren't accurate about me.    \"But I have a tremendous amount of love and respect for the West family.

Watch Adams walk off \u00bb    Earlier, as the show began, King said Adams had received a letter from West's family, saying that if Adams discussed West's case on the show, the family would ask the Medical Board of California to decertify him.    Adams' brief appearance and walkout followed discussions with his attorney and \"Larry King Live\" producers.    \"To the extent there are issues about even why he's here, why this is in the media, it relates to the relationship he had with his patient,\" Alan Tenenbaum, one of West's attorneys, told King.  Watch CNN's Lola Ogunnaike describe the backstage drama \u00bb    \"So until he gets clearance from the family, I don't think it would be fair or right for him to talk about these things.\"    The letter from West family attorneys asking Adams not to go on the show was faxed to one of Adams' attorneys in California, Tenenbaum said.  Watch Larry King discuss the strange scene \u00bb    West, 58, died November 10 after she was found unresponsive and in respiratory distress at her home, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said. Her funeral was held Tuesday in Spencer, Oklahoma.    An autopsy was inconclusive pending the results of toxicology tests, coroner's spokesman Ed Winter said last week. But preliminary reports indicate West may have died from complications of cosmetic surgery, which was performed by Adams the day before, he said.    Adams told TMZ.com that he performed a tummy tuck and breast reduction on West and that her death was unforeseen.    But another Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon said he had recently refused to perform a procedure on West until she had medical clearance for a condition he feared could lead to a heart attack.    \"The preliminary information we had indicated that she had several minor medical issues, but I can't comment on those,\" Winter said. West was taking some medications, Winter added, but could not say which ones and in what dosages pending the toxicology reports.    West was in good condition before the surgery, Winter said. Investigators are talking with Adams about the surgery.    Adams told TMZ.com that West's death could have been caused by a heart attack, pulmonary embolism or massive vomiting. He said he consulted with her for months and she changed her mind several times about going forward with the surgery, TMZ.com said.    TMZ.com, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.    Legal documents filed in California show that Adams faces disciplinary action from the state Medical Board for multiple DUI convictions and that he has paid nearly $500,000 in at least two malpractice lawsuits.    Last week, Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon Andre Aboolian said through his publicist that Donda West consulted him in June about a procedure. Publicist Jo-Ann Geffen said West contacted Aboolian again two weeks ago to say she was ready to go forward, but Aboolian said he needed a medical clearance before he would perform the surgery.    \"I always insist on a medical clearance for women over 40, and in this instance it was particularly important because of a condition she had that I felt could have led to a heart attack,\" Aboolian said, according to Geffen's statement.    West was scheduled to see an internist for the appropriate tests, but did not keep the appointment, Geffen said.    Donda West was a major influence on her son's life, as the music producer-singer-songwriter has often said -- including in lyrics to some of his songs. She regularly attended her son's concerts and was at his performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September.

Police officers survey the wreckage of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.  The payment ends Tripoli's legal liability in U.S. terror cases and paves the way for increased U.S. involvement in the oil-rich nation.  President Bush signed an executive order Friday restoring Libyan immunity from terrorism-related lawsuits and dismissing pending cases over compensation as part of a deal reached this summer.  David Welch, the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, who negotiated the agreement, called Libya's rehabilitation from a terrorist nation to a U.S. ally \"historic.\"  The pact closes the book on a contentious period in U.S.-Libyan relations, which began in the 1980s with a series of attacks involving the two countries, including the bombings of Pan Am flight 103, a German disco and U.S. airstrikes over Libya.  U.S. business executives hope the new relationship will lead to billions of dollars of new investment in Libya, a country rich in petroleum reserves but lacking a developed infrastructure.  This summer, the United States and Libya signed a deal for the State Department to create a $1.8 billion compensation fund to finalize the claims for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1986 bombing of La Belle disco in Berlin, Germany. It also compensates Libyan victims of U.S. airstrikes in the 1980s.  Congress unanimously adopted the Libyan Claims Resolution Act, sponsored by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, which cleared the way to end the feud and created the victim compensation fund.  Under the agreement, Libya pays more than $500 million to settle remaining claims from the Lockerbie case and more than $280 million for victims of the disco bombing. It will also set aside funds to compensate victims of several other incidents blamed on Libya, although Libya has not accepted responsibility.  In exchange, Libya will now be exempt from legislation passed this year enabling terrorism victims to be compensated using frozen assets of governments blamed for attacks. Tripoli sought the protection to encourage U.S. companies to invest in Libya without fear of being sued by terrorism victims or their families.  An initial payment of $300 million was received this month, after the opening of a U.S. trade office in Libya and a historic visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Another $600 million was received Thursday and the remaining $600 million Friday, Welch said, adding that the families could start receiving payments within days.  The remaining $300 million will go to Libyan victims of the bombing in Libya by U.S. warplanes in 1986. Libyans say dozens of people died in the U.S. air attack, including an adopted daughter of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.  President Reagan ordered the attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi after two U.S. soldiers were killed and 79 Americans were injured in the 1986 Berlin disco bombing.  The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. Of the dead, 259 people died on board the plane and another 11 on the ground.  Libya has paid 268 families involved in the Pan Am bombing $8 million each of a $10 million settlement. But it withheld the remaining $2 million owed to each family over a dispute regarding U.S. obligations to Tripoli.  A group of relatives of Pan Am victims said in a statement Friday that they applauded Libya's fulfillment of the agreement.  \"The Pan Am 103 families deeply appreciate Sen. Lautenberg's work to urge the administration to take every step to bring the agreement to fruition,\" spokeswoman Kara Weipz said in the statement. \"While our loved ones will never be forgotten, we are glad this chapter in our efforts is finally over.\"  Ties between the two countries began to improve in 2003, when Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction program and began compensating Lockerbie victims. But lingering lawsuits prevented the two countries from fully normalizing ties.  The State Department has said the deal was pursued on a \"purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party.\"  Senior State Department officials said the formula was designed to respect Libyan sensitivities about compensating victims for incidents for which it hasn't taken responsibility and also allow Libya to settle outstanding claims for the air strikes on Tripoli. Donations to settle Libyan claims were placed in the \"voluntary\" fund, from which each country involved in the claims draws the money to pay its citizens.  Welch would not say exactly where the money came from but stressed that no American taxpayer money would be used to compensate Libya.  The deal is to be followed by an upgrading of U.S. relations with Libya, including the confirmation of a U.S. ambassador, which was held up until the payments were made.  Lautenberg applauded the payment Friday.  \"American victims and their families have waited decades for Libya to pay for its deadly acts of violence and today they have received long-overdue justice,\" he said in a statement. \"I am pleased that our relentless pressure and support for terror victims has led to this historic moment.\"  Rice's visit in September, the first by a secretary of state since 1953, was hailed by both countries as a breakthrough.

New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin attends a ceremony Friday honoring Hurricane Katrina victims.    Hurricane Gustav is poised to pass near or over the Cayman Islands on Friday night and over western portions of Cuba on Saturday. It may approach the U.S. Gulf Coast by Tuesday morning as a Category 2 or 3 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said Friday.    \"Today, on that third anniversary, we've got to be thinking about the future,\" Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said. \"As we pray for the best, we're going to prepare for the worst,\"    Barbour announced Friday that Hurricane Katrina victims living in government-issued trailers or mobile homes along his state's coast will begin evacuating this weekend to prepare for the Gustav's possible arrival.    The process will begin Saturday, with notices going out to people living in Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers or mobile homes, as well as people living in more permanent structures known as \"Mississippi cottages,\" he said.  Watch the Gulf Coast states prepare for Gustav \u00bb    The evacuation will begin in Harrison and Hancock counties on Sunday morning, Barbour said. Evacuation in Jackson County will begin Monday.    About 4,300 families live in FEMA trailers or mobile homes, and 2,800 live in Mississippi cottages, the governor's office said. He said he would urge people living in privately owned mobile homes to evacuate as well.    President Bush declared an emergency in Louisiana on Friday, freeing up federal aid and allowing FEMA to coordinate relief efforts.    Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency and urged residents to update their evacuation plans.    He said residents in certain southern parishes could be asked to leave Friday or Saturday. In Plaquemines Parish, where Hurricane Katrina roared ashore as a Category 3 storm days after its initial landfall in Florida, Parish President Billy Nungesser called for a mandatory evacuation beginning at noon Saturday.    Residents of the community of Grand Isle in Jefferson Parish were urged to begin voluntary evacuations Friday afternoon, and voluntary evacuations for Jean Lafitte, Crown Point, Barataria and areas outside the levee protection system are recommended beginning at noon Saturday, the parish said in a news release.    St. Bernard Parish, which was beginning transport Friday for those who would need assistance, said it expected to call a mandatory evacuation Saturday afternoon.    In New Orleans, which has yet to fully recover from Hurricane Katrina, Mayor Ray Nagin on Thursday urged residents living in FEMA units to make evacuation plans in case city officials order them to leave.  Watch Sean Callebs report on if New Orleans is prepared \u00bb    \"Travel trailers are unsafe during heavy winds,\" he said. \"As we continue to monitor and prepare for the possibility of Hurricane Gustav, I want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so.\"    As of early this week, there were 2,829 FEMA trailers in Orleans Parish, the mayor's office said.    The city has designated 17 sites for people without transportation to board buses that would take them out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation. The city also arranged with Amtrak for more than 7,000 seats to evacuate the elderly by train, said Jerry Sneed of City Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.    Signs of mobilization were apparent at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, where nearly every departure gate had long lines of elderly people in wheelchairs. Rental car counters normally attended by tourists were filled with relief workers from the Red Cross and the Fire Department of New York's Disaster Assistance Response Team.    The DART team consisted of retired New York firefighters, jovial men with graying hair and larger waistlines. Many are volunteers assisting the Red Cross who were in New York during the September 11 attacks and wanted to give back.    The 40-member DART team of heavy-equipment operators, truck drivers and registered nurses was headed to Alexandria, Louisiana, to set up an evacuation shelter.    After the storm, the team will feed, shelter and re-supply people in the areas affected by Gustav.    \"Whatever small way you're able to help, it's a great feeling,\" said Kevin Wallace, a 23-year FDNY veteran who's helped after six disasters. \"Whatever they need us to do, we do.\"    All 2,500 inmates in Orleans Parish would be bused out from state and local facilities, Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff Marlin Gusman told the New Orleans Times-Picayune.    New Orleans Police Chief Warren Riley said this week that hundreds of officers will be posted in the uptown, downtown, Central City and West Bank areas to ensure an adequate law enforcement presence in the event of an emergency.    During Katrina, many New Orleans officers were accused of leaving their posts as widespread crime and looting permeated the city. Sixty-seven officers were fired for it, Riley said.    In addition to the police department's actions, at least 1,500 Louisiana National Guard members arrived in New Orleans on Friday.    Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his concerns for New Orleans are twofold. First, he was worried about areas of potential weakness in the levee system, which he said the Army Corps of Engineers monitor closely, and second, rainfall.    \"You can build levees that are 100 feet high; it's not going to keep the rain out of the city. A very, very intense period of rain could flood the city, because the pace of the rainfall could exceed the ability to pump out of the city,\" he said.    The only thing to do was prepare, he said.    \"We evacuate; we protect the integrity of the levees; we continue to strengthen the levees; that's part of a total system of really driving down the risk to the people of New Orleans,\" he said.    The Louisiana National Guard has requested 20 helicopters from eight states to replace its helicopter air assault battalion, which is now serving in Iraq with its 20 UH-60 Black Hawks.    The Guard is asking for UH-60 helicopters for search and rescue, as well as CH-47s, Chinooks, which could drop large sandbags if the levees are breached.    A 40-person aviation headquarters unit also is being requested and probably will be provided by the Arkansas National Guard to handle air traffic control and communications for any air operations that might be needed.    In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry pre-emptively declared an emergency in 61 Texas counties. He said also the state had agreed to take into its shelters several thousand Louisiana residents, should they evacuate.

A computer-generated image of Club Watt, Rotterdam's human-powered club.    Couch potatoes will be horrified, but fresh advances in human-powered technology -- where users power appliances through their own motion -- could one day see a 'workout-to-watch' scenario become reality.    Human power is rapidly gaining in popularity worldwide as businesses seek 'greener' methods of operating.    The profile of the technology is set to receive a further boost this month when a human-powered gym opens in Portland, Oregon, and again in September when the human-powered 'sustainable dance club', Club Watt, opens its doors in Rotterdam, Netherlands.    Human power is already being used to run the 'California Fitness' gym in Hong Kong, and to power the recently opened 'Club Surya' in London. iReport.com: Can you predict what the future will be like?    Beyond all of this, further concepts have been developed for human-powered 'river gyms' for the waterways of New York.    But, how does your sweat and strain turn into power for lights, music and machines?    The general concept is known as energy harvesting, which simply refers to the gathering of energy from one source and applying it to power an object.    Italian inventor Lucien Gambarota, who designed California Fitness's method of storing energy and using it to power lights and music in the gym, told CNN the concept is straightforward.    \"One of the oldest types of energy used by people is muscular energy -- so this is nothing new.\"    Gambarota said machines such as exercycles created a load, used as a counter-force by means of a resistor.    \"I disconnected the resistor and started storing the energy into a battery... that is then used as power. It was a way to show there can be very simple solutions. It doesn't always have to be high-tech,\" he said.    Portland's 'green' gym will have spinning bikes connected to wind-generator motors. The users should generate enough electricity to power the gym's music system or run personal DVD players on the machines, the gym's manager Adam Boesel predicts.    While harnessing the energy from people working out at a gym seems logical, utilising the movement of clubbers at dance clubs is a little more complex.    Two methods have developed -- the first of which is piezoelectricity, used by Club Surya, where crystals in blocks under the dance-floor rub together with the assistance of dancers on the floor. This generates an electrical charge which is then fed into batteries.    A second method using wheels to generate energy under a slightly moving floor will be used at the soon-to-be-opened Club Watt. This model involves coils and magnets which move under the dance-floor to create a charge.    Vera Verkooijen, spokeswoman for Sustainable Dance Club, the company which is behind the floor for Club Watt and produces smaller, portable floors, said the human power would be enough to power about 30 percent of the club's requirements.    Verkooijen admitted the first floors were not very efficient, and said the designers were already working on new models to improve the amount of energy captured.    \"This is just the first version. We are willing to take it further,\" she said.    At Club Surya the power shortfall is made up by solar panels and a wind turbine.    Putting the current buzz aside, how far could this human-powered technology develop? And how widely can it be applied?    Verkooijen told CNN she already had some indications of where the technology was heading.    \"We receive a lot of requests from other companies for people who want to use the floors. We get many of these for bus and train stations -- places where there are lots of people.\"    Lights and display boards at those spaces could be powered applying the same concept as that being used in Club Watt, she said.    Evert Raaijen, technical director of energy conversion company Exendis, felt the technology could have a number of different applications. From pedal-powered computers on bicycles, to self-powered soldiers in militaries, Raaijen predicted human power would be developed widely in coming years.    \"I think it's a science field which will be one of the future,\" he said.    Gambarota believed there were ways human power could be brought into practical use in the home.    He had generated an idea of using human-powered batteries for television or portable video game consoles.    \"With so many kids not exercising enough, a battery could be created for these devices so they had to create the energy to use them. The same could be done for television sets.    \"We could get the situation where people have to cycle so they can use it,\" Gambarota said.    Despite these potential developments, human-power is attracting its share of criticism.    Although he shows enthusiasm for the battery project, Gambarota, who now spends much of his time developing micro wind turbines, is sceptical about the future of human-power on a mass-scale.    He raises doubts about the efficiency of human power and questioned its economic viability.    The average amount of power one person could produce going about normal activities on any given day was about one kilowatt-hour (kWh), which only amounted to about \u20ac 0.10 worth of electricity, Gambarota said.    \"It's a very good marketing tool for businesses, but in terms of economics it does not make sense at all.\"    The main reason it was being used was because companies wanted to \"look green, taste green and smell green\", he said.    Raaijen, who was consulted on the Sustainable Dance Floor project, agreed that opting for human-powered technology at present was not a financially-based decision.    \"The project (dance floor) in itself doesn't save a lot of energy. It's more of a statement than anything.\"    Observing recent trends, the sustained drive for 'green energy' should continue to push human-powered technology forward, and despite the limitations to development, human-powered gyms, dance clubs, and maybe even video game consoles are likely to feature strongly in our immediate future."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/fbc2d5f3f088eda2b8128ebb12a042850f6e4f3d.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what is the drug being used", "id": "108844", "answers": [{"text": "anti-anxiety", "answer_start": 782}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying, acrobatic moves.  Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June.  The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship.  Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington. At the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves.  In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later.  When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, \"It can make you aggressive, the steroids. But personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either.\"  Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England. He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes.  Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body.  And from the steroids, he said.  Billington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses. He took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers.  Benoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon.  McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: \"Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. How did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster.\" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview  Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show.  \"Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,\" McMahon said.  Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business.  His businesses are quite successful. About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs -- \"Raw\" and \"Friday Night Smackdown\" -- are weekly ratings giants. Pay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year.  When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena.  \"If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,\" he said.  He also said there isn't \"any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free.\"  Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong \u00bb  The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons.  David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning.  But Dr. Gary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough.  \"It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,\" he said. \"And there is a gold standard, and I measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard. And [the WWE is] miles apart.\"  Wadler, a longtime critic of McMahon, was referring to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado. U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a two-year suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life.  Black's programs test wrestlers four times a year. The first is a \"baseline\" test, according to the WWE. Black then tests for \"nonmedical\" uses, meaning that if an athlete has a prescription, he is cleared.  \"It's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program,\" said Travis Tygart, who heads the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.  McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years.  Watch one of the new WWE stars talk about being \"straight edge\" \u00bb  \"There's an expression in our business, that here is where you make your money. It's your face, it's what you do with it,\" he said. \"It's your personality, it's what you do with it. It's your delivery, your elocution.

Rep. Chris Shays, R-Connecticut, failed to win his 11th full term.      Democrats clinched a majority and took at least 21 seats from Republicans, with the GOP taking only four from the Democrats, according to CNN projections as of 4 a.m. ET Wednesday.      With winners yet to be called for 11 of the House's 435 seats, Democrats were projected to win 251 seats, with Republicans having 173.      Heading into Election Day, the Democrats had a 235-199 majority. The Democrats' apparent gains Tuesday come two years after they took control of the House -- with a gain of 30 seats -- after 12 years in the minority.      Among Tuesday's GOP casualties was longtime Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, whose reputation for occasionally bucking his party couldn't keep him from losing to Democrat Jim Himes.      Shays' defeat leaves New England without any Republicans in the House. Shays was seeking his 11th full term.

Watch Pelosi say Americans voted for change      \"We have surfers to ride that wave,\" Pelosi said at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, where she was watching election results.      Here are highlights of other races with projected winners:      \u2022 Democrats gained at least two seats in Ohio, including that of Rep. Steve Chabot, who was seeking an eighth term in a Cincinnati-area district that normally votes about evenly for GOP and Democratic presidential candidates.      CNN projects that Chabot lost to Democrat Steve Driehaus. Just two years earlier, Chabot was re-elected with 52 percent of the vote despite an anti-Republican tide that helped Democrats capture Ohio's governorship and take a U.S. Senate seat.      Democrats also gained a seat left open by retiring Rep. Ralph Regula. Democrat John Boccieri defeated the GOP's Kirk Schuring in the northeastern Ohio contest.      \u2022 In New York, Democrats won three Republican seats, including two left open by incumbents not seeking re-election. In one of the open races, Democrat Mike McMahon won the last GOP-held seat in New York City, defeating the GOP's Robert Straniere. Democrat Dan Maffei defeated Republican Dale Sweetland, who was trying to win a seat vacated by 10-term GOP Rep. Jim Walsh.      In a rematch of a 2006 race, former naval officer Eric Massa beat GOP Rep. Randy Kuhl in a western New York district that generally votes Republican.      \u2022 Freshman Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, was projected to survive a race that tightened after she made comments about Sen. Barack Obama last month. She was leading Democratic challenger Elwyn Tinklenberg 47 percent to 43 percent with 86 percent of precincts reporting.      Bachmann set off a storm of criticism in October when she said Obama's connection to 1960s radical William Ayers made her concerned that Obama may have anti-American views. Bachmann's comments prompted a flood of fundraising for Tinklenberg.      \u2022 In Florida, Democrats captured from Republicans two of the four seats that analysts thought they could win. Democrat Suzanne Kosmas defeated Rep. Tom Fenney, and Democrat Alan Grayson defeated Rep. Ric Keller.      However, brothers and Republicans Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart, who represent districts in southern Florida, held off their Democratic challengers. Lincoln Diaz-Balart won a ninth term, defeating former Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez.      \u2022 Democratic incumbents weren't invulnerable in Florida. Rep. Tim Mahoney -- a south-central Florida Democrat elected to replace scandal-plagued GOP Rep. Mark Foley in 2006 -- lost to his Republican challenger, Tom Rooney.      Mahoney already was going to have a tough race in his Republican-leaning district. But the race became tougher in mid-October with allegations that Mahoney had an affair with one of his aides and paid her thousands of dollars in hush money.      Mahoney admitted to causing \"pain\" in his marriage, but he denied paying the aide to keep quiet.      \u2022 In Pennsylvania, Rep. John Murtha handily defeated Republican challenger William Russell. Republicans had hoped to defeat Murtha after he called his western Pennsylvania district \"a racist area\" and \"redneck.\"    \u2022 The House's third-ranking Republican, Rep. Adam Putnam of central Florida, was re-elected but wrote to his colleagues Tuesday night that he wouldn't run again for a leadership post, saying he wanted to return his focus \"to crafting public policy solutions for America's generational challenges.\" He is currently the GOP conference chairman.      \u2022 In a heavily Republican district near Houston, Texas, Democratic Rep. Nick Lampson lost his re-election bid against Pete Olson. Lampson won the seat in 2006 after Republican and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay resigned to fight state money laundering charges.      \u2022 In Ohio's 11th District, Democrats easily took a seat that was vacant since the death of Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones. Democrat Marcia Fudge defeated Republican Thomas Pekarek.      Tubbs Jones, who represented the district that covers parts of Cleveland and its suburbs, died in August after brain hemorrhaging caused by an aneurysm.      \u2022 The House's first two Muslim members, Rep.

He said he alerted a tower at the airport that a landing on the highway was imminent, Richardson said."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/63ba4107135a1e077c9c64d06d14f8b4d48c6030.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "For what  was the party held?", "id": "108858", "answers": [{"text": "U.S. arrival of Spotify,", "answer_start": 701}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "(CNN) -- At 31, Sean Parker has a lot more going for him than Justin Timberlake.      As the co-founder of music-sharing service Napster and the former president of Facebook, he's an Internet pioneer. He's a billionaire. And he throws a hell of a party.      Last week, during Facebook's f8 conference in San Francisco, Parker transformed an empty warehouse into one big VIP room, complete with a lavish buffet and celebrity guests. Despite having only two days to plan the event, he somehow managed to get Snoop Dogg, the Killers and Jane's Addiction to perform for a few hundred invited guests. Estimates put the party tab at $1 million or more.      The purpose of the shindig was to celebrate the U.S. arrival of Spotify, the music-streaming service in which Parker is a major investor. Spotify also is partnering with Facebook to let users play and share music within the social network.      The event featured an onstage chat between Parker and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Beside every chair in the media's seating section sat a bottle of high-end tequila. Of the hundreds of media events I've attended over the years, this is the first time I've seen that.      Not in attendance was Timberlake, the singer-turned-actor who portrayed Parker as a backstabbing opportunist in last year's \"The Social Network.\" In past interviews, Parker has called the movie \"a complete work of fiction.\"      After the Killers played, I sat down with Parker for a few minutes in a private area upstairs. The first thing we talked about was Napster. I mentioned that I would never forget that feeling of downloading free music, that it felt like you had won one of those contests where you could fill up your shopping cart for free.      \"I still hear that a lot,\" he told me.      Here are a few excerpts from our talk, edited for clarity:      On his affinity with Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning:      \"Fanning and I immediately realized that we had an interest in more than just computers and software and hacking and security, that we actually had an interest in doing something with a broader cultural importance. One of those ideas was Napster.\"      On being a billionaire      \"I definitely wanted to earn my freedom. But the primary motivation wasn't making money, but making an impact. I think the perception of wealth and power is that things just become easier and easier when in reality as you raise the stakes things become more stressful. You just keep pushing yourself harder and harder to achieve more and more -- I don't think it's ever quite as glamorous as it appears on the outside.\"      On Apple's Steve Jobs      \"Steve is one the greatest business artists in history and has had more impact through his product design in Apple than any other CEO.\"      On Timberlake's unflattering depiction of him      \"It's a blessing and a curse in the sense it definitely raised my profile somewhat -- that character in the film played by Justin Timberlake represents a set of values that I just don't agree with. It's difficult watching a character using your name and interacting with people [while] supposedly [doing] a portrayal of you.\"      On his business role      \"Early on I wanted to run a company, but I quickly realized there was this other model available. Maybe I'm blazing a new path with this model because you don't typically see this. You see investors who have portfolio companies but aren't very active, or entrepreneurs who typically run one company for their entire life, or occasionally, serial entrepreneurs who do a series of small companies. But they typically run them for a fairly long period of time. I've been doing a hybrid of investing and entrepreneurship, which I think initially I wasn't set out to do. But I realized it fit my personality.\""}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9a13500a6e79137047c29eab893bd0377f859742.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was the groups final destination?", "id": "108861", "answers": [{"text": "Afghanistan.", "answer_start": 2843}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Washington (CNN) -- A representative at the Virginia mosque of five Americans arrested in Pakistan said it plans to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the arrests.      The men were arrested by Pakistani police this week amid suspicion that they were plotting terrorist attacks and planned to go to Afghanistan, a development that shocked members of the ICNA Center, the mosque the five attended.      At a news conference Friday, friends of the five and members of the mosque expressed their surprise over the arrests, defending the activities at the mosque as positive and describing the five as \"wholesome, regular kids.\"      Attorney Ashraf Nubani said he believes the incident is isolated, but said the mosque is conducting an inquiry into the matter.      While members of the mosque didn't comment on the reports and charges emerging from Pakistan, they described a tight-knit, patriotic congregation that focused on community service. They were grateful for the actions of law enforcement and expressed profound empathy for the families of the people held.      A Pakistani police interrogation report, dated Thursday, shined more light on the Wednesday arrests of the five Americans at a home in Sargodha, a town about 120 miles south of Islamabad. The men will be transferred to Lahore, Pakistan, for security reasons, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Friday. A sixth man -- the father of one of the five -- was arrested afterward, police said.      Read the interrogation report (PDF)      The report carries profile detail about the men and shows pictures of Internet sites, laptops, mobile phones, an iPod, and an external hard drive seized by police.      \"They had deep interest in the religion and they were of the opinion that a jihad must be waged against the infidels for the atrocities committed by them against Muslims around the world,\" said the report, which refers to the five as college students.      The report focused on one of the suspects -- identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, a 20-year-old American born in Virginia. It said he regularly goes online to watch attacks on the U.S. military in Afghanistan and that he left comments praising the actions. That caught the attention of militants, and he was eventually contacted by a person named Saifullah, the report said.      After contact had been made, a Yahoo! e-mail account was set up so the men and militants could communicate, the report said. E-mails were never sent from the account, but people would leave messages in the draft sections of the e-mail account and delete them after reading them, the Pakistani police report said.      \"This mode of communication enabled them to pass on messages without fear of interception by the FBI,\" it said.      The report said the suspects made a plan with Saifullah to go from Pakistan to Afghanistan. They gathered in Karachi and left for Hyderabad on December 1. They tried to hook up with two militant groups -- Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa -- but neither group showed interest.      \"They went to the madrassa [a Muslim school] of Jaish-e-Mohammad where they informed them about their desire for jihad. However, the management of the madrassa refused to keep them, and advised them to go to Jamat-ud-Dawa Lahore. Interestingly, the Jamat also refused to keep them as they could not provide a surety. Thus, they came along with their friend Umar Farooq to Sargodha,\" the report said.      The FBI said Pakistan authorities detained the men -- four of whom it said were found to have American passports -- on Wednesday, \"after they came to the attention of police.\" An FBI statement did not give further details and did not identify the men.      Officials said the six men include three Pakistani-Americans, an Ethiopian-American, an Egyptian-American and an Eritrean-American.      Along with Minni, there were snapshots and brief profiles of only four others -- Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan, and Ramy Zamzam -- all from the Washington area. The sixth man was Khalid Farouk, father of Umar, the report said.      Mustafa Abu Maryam, a volunteer youth coordinator, said he never saw \"extreme behavior\" from the suspects, noting that youth group discussions never broached on politics or conflict.      \"Our main focus is to be a positive force of good in our young men's lives. To be a deterrent of wrong groups and gangs and all other negative influences out there, to be a positive model for these kids,\" Abu Maryam said.      Mahdi Bray, executive director of the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation, said the incident is a \"wake-up call\" to the many negative influences youth face and touched on what he said were harmful messages sweeping across cyberspace. \"We are determined not to let religious extremists exploit the vulnerability of the emotions of our children through slick, seductive and destructive propaganda on the Internet. We are sending a message loud and clear that those days are over where we will not respond in kind on the Internet to vile propaganda that misrepresents the Islamic faith,\" Bray said.      Subira Farouk, the wife of Khalid and mother of Umar, said on Thursday that she and her husband had traveled to Pakistan to arrange a marriage for Umar, and to her surprise, her son had arrived in the country shortly afterward."}]}, {"title": "./cnn/stories/9eccfcc231c7c0d65cb0c333cb3d1731a5fe2f3f.story", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What are the issues according to Washington", "id": "108862", "answers": [{"text": "the crisis affecting our children.", "answer_start": 544}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Editor's Note: Two-time Oscar winner Denzel Washington joined the Mt. Vernon Boys & Girls Club in New York at the age of 6 and remained an active member for the next 12 years. The actor credits his early years spent at the club with changing the direction of his life. Since 1994, he has served as a volunteer national spokesman for Boys & Girls Clubs of America, appearing in public service announcements on television and in print. He's also a member of the group's board.    Denzel Washington says America's leaders need to pay attention to the crisis affecting our children.    (CNN) -- With the political season in full swing, much is at stake for America. The economy is in a downward spiral. We have an energy crisis. Our jobless rate is on the rise.    These are the subjects that generate headlines and much debate among the candidates.    But there is an underlying problem that we as a nation have not addressed, a situation that should concern any American with an eye on the future, regardless of party affiliation. It is the crisis affecting our children:    \u2022 Nearly 30 percent of this year's freshman class will drop out of high school, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That number jumps to 40 percent in some urban areas.    \u2022 The obesity rate for our kids has gone up by as much as 300 percent since 1980, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, triggering a host of health-related problems, from diabetes to heart disease.    \u2022 Young people account for more than 20 percent of violent crimes in the United States, according to statistics cited by Duke University's Center for Child and Family Policy. Violent juvenile crime peaks between 3 and 4 p.m., at the end of the school day.    These facts are grim enough. Factor in persistent patterns of poverty, gang activity, drug abuse and teenage pregnancy, and you have a generation of Americans that will be unprepared -- indeed, unable -- to meet the challenges posed by a complex world.    We expect our leaders to lead. But as citizens, we shouldn't simply sit back and hope that politicians stand up to the test.  We can participate in the political process, advocating for policies that will benefit the health, education and well-being of young Americans, because we must do a better job of preparing our youth to lead.    It is daunting to think about solving such a widespread crisis. But there are youth-serving organizations that can and do play a key role in effecting positive change -- places such as Boys & Girls Clubs, with a long track record of helping young people turn things around, get an education, lead healthy lives and become effective leaders.    I know, because I was one of those kids. Club staff taught me right from wrong and made the lesson stick. They planted the seeds early on that led me to envision myself as a high school graduate, a college graduate and an achiever in whatever field I chose.    Boys & Girls Clubs do this today for millions of kids, offering everything from homework help to career exploration, performing a daily miracle that turns hope into opportunity. Urging children and the adults in their lives to \"Be Great,\" these clubs communicate the idea that there is potential for greatness in every child. This powerful call to action reminds us that we can all play a role in helping youth realize their dreams.    So I ask you to join me in this effort. There are many ways to help:    \u2022 Volunteering at a local youth organization. \u2022 Leading by example. \u2022 Donating to charities that make a difference.    In partnership with government, schools, community leaders and parents, we can create a network and culture in which everyone embraces the importance of a positive future for our youth.    But right now, with Election Day fast approaching, ask your local, state and national candidates what they are doing to help our young people become tomorrow's leaders. Ask them to make children a top priority and tell them that you hold them accountable. If we all become advocates for our children, elected officials might just take action.    We can do better. And if we care about our nation's future, we must do better.

Adult obesity rates went up in 23 states in the past year, a survey shows.    The percentage of adults classified as obese went up in 23 states, but Mississippi, with 32.5 percent, stayed atop the latest annual rankings by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Trust for America's Health. The same survey put the state's adult obesity rate at 31.7 percent in 2008.    In addition, 44.4 percent of Mississippi children ages 10 to 17 are classified as overweight or obese, the study found.    Doctors have linked obesity to increased risks of a variety of conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, arthritis and heart disease. Wednesday's study found the current U.S. economic slump could worsen the problem by putting more nutritious food out of the reach of struggling families.  See a map of obesity in the U.S. \u00bb    \"At the same time, safety-net programs and services are becoming increasingly overextended as the numbers of unemployed, uninsured and underinsured Americans continue to grow,\" the report states. \"For many people, too, worries over the recession are triggering increased depression, anxiety and stress, which often can be linked to obesity.\"    Dr. Ed Thompson, Mississippi's state health officer, called the report -- which was drawn from state figures -- \"old data rehashed.\" But he said the state is taking steps to address what he called \"a multifaceted problem,\" targeting schoolchildren in particular.    Thompson said teachers not only are trying to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and exercise, they are changing schedules to increase the amount of physical activity students experience in a day. In addition, lower-calorie, lower-fat foods are replacing some high-calorie, high starch lunchroom staples, he said.    \"We can't tell our children to eat wise dietary choices and then provide them with little except for poor dietary choices in their school cafeterias,\" Thompson said.    Rounding out the top five states among adults were West Virginia, with 31.2 percent of its population considered obese; Alabama, 31.1 percent; Tennessee, 30.2 percent; and South Carolina 29.7 percent.    At the bottom of the rankings, Colorado had the lowest percentage of obese adults, with 18.9 percent. It was followed by Massachusetts, at 21.2 percent; Connecticut, 21.3; Rhode Island, 21.7; and Hawaii, 21.8. Even in those states, the obesity rate grew by fractions of a percent since 2008, according to the study.    Thompson said most adults know they should eat less and exercise. \"The hard part is getting people to actually practice these things,\" he said.    \"Our work lives require less physical exertion than they used to,\" he said. \"With less physical activity, we should have adjusted our dietary consumption downward.\"    While deep-fried Southern cooking is legendary, Mississippi also ranks high in poverty statistics and low in education -- two factors commonly related to obesity. But Thompson said education appears to be more closely related to obesity than poverty.    \"We do see obesity among people who are in lower socioeconomic levels, but we see it in higher socioeconomic levels as well,\" he said. \"Being poor does not not make you obese, and being rich does not make you thin.\"    The survey used the Body Mass Index standards set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC defines someone as obese if they have a BMI -- a figure based on a ratio of height to weight -- of 30 or more, while anyone with a BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight.  Calculate your Body Mass Index \u00bb    Adult obesity rates went up in 23 states in the past year, with 31 states now reporting rates over 25 percent. By comparison, no state topped 20 percent in 1991, the survey's authors reported."}]}]}
